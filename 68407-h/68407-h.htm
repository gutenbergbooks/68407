<p class="ph2">THE WONDER WOMAN</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>TWO WOMEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“DO you see her now, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>I nodded, pointing into the coals.
“I see a lion, and an old witch, and
a monkey. I don’t see any woman.”</p>

<p>“There! There!” I cried. “She’s just going
through the postern gate. Oh, she’s gone, lad!
Never mind! Next time you may see her.”</p>

<p>“And is she prettier’n Wanza, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not prettier,” I responded.
“Wanza looking out from beneath the pink-lined
umbrella on her peddler’s cart is very charming,
indeed. But the woman I see in the fire is—oh,
she’s altogether different!”</p>

<p>This was the customary tenor of my conversation
with Joey as we sat before our fire of pine
knots of an evening. The lad would point out
to me queer kaleidoscopic creatures he saw deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
in the heart of the pine fire; but his young eyes
never saw the face I beheld there, and so I was
obliged to describe my wonder woman to him.</p>

<p>It was not strange that Joey should share my
confidence in this fashion. He had been my sole
companion since the night four years before when
I had found him—poor tiny lad—sobbing on the
doorstep of a shack some three miles down the
river. I had lifted him to my shoulder and entered
the shack to find there a dying woman.
The woman died that night, but before she passed
away she gave the child to me, saying: “He is
only a waif! I took him from my poor brother
when he died over on the Sound, about six
months ago. My brother was a fisherman. He
picked the child up on the beach one morning
after a fierce storm a year ago. I was meaning
to keep the boy always, poor as I be. But now—you
take Joey, mister,—he’ll be a blessing to
you!”</p>

<p>A blessing! I said the words over to myself
as I carried the boy home that night. I said
them to myself when I awakened in the morning
and looked down at him cradled in the hollow
of my arm. I had been out of conceit with life.
For me the world was “jagged and broken” in
very truth. But looking down at the young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
stranger I thrilled with the sudden desire to
smooth and shape my days again. To stand
sure! And here was a companion for me! I
was through with living alone!</p>

<p>I went to the window, threw it wide, and saw
the dawn rosy in the east. A mountain bluebird
that had a nest in a hole in a cottonwood
tree hard by was perched on a serviceberry bush
beside the window. I heard its song with rapture.
I was smiling when I turned back to the
bunk where I had left the child. The child was
smiling too. He sat straight up among the blankets,
his eyes were fixed on the bird, and he was
holding out his little arms. I lifted him and
carried him to the window, and he lisped: “I
love birdie! I love you!”</p>

<p>And so Joey became my boy.</p>

<p>It was not only in the heart of the pine fire
that I saw the radiant creature I described to
Joey. When I looked from my workshop door
at twilight across the shadowy river to the cool
purple peaks of the mountains, the nebular mist
arising seemed the cloud-folds of her garments.
And when I lay on my back at noon time, in the
cedar grove, gazing upward through the shivering
green dome at the sky, I always dreamed of
the splendor of her eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>I grew to wonder how I should meet her.
Someway, I always pictured myself astride my
good cayuse, Buttons, on the river road returning
from Roselake village, gay in my holiday
clothes, with a freshly shaven face, and a bag of
peppermints in my pocket for Joey.</p>

<p>As it fell out I was in my shop by the river
at work on a cedar chest. I was garbed in a
dark-blue flannel shirt and blue overalls, and
needed a hair-cut sadly. I heard a sound and
looked up. “She has come!” I said to myself.
“Out of the land of dreams she has come to
me!”</p>

<p>A young woman stood before me. The face
I saw was oval and flawless. The cheeks were a
delicate pink. Her lips were vivid, her eyes
luminous as stars. Her silky, lustrous hair was
bound with a broad band of blue ribbon. Although
her riding skirt was torn, her blouse soiled,
although she was dusty and disheveled, with
shadows of weariness about her splendid eyes, her
manner was that of a young princess as she addressed
me.</p>

<p>“This place is for sale, I understand?”</p>

<p>I had not thought of selling the few acres that
remained of the hundred-and-sixty-acre homestead
I had taken up eight years before; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
was so overcome with awe and confusion, that I
stammered forth:</p>

<p>“Why, no—that is, I think not! I shall sell
some time, I dare say.”</p>

<p>Her face showed a flash of amusement and
then grew thoughtful.</p>

<p>“It is a desirable place,” she murmured, half to
herself.</p>

<p>I knew then she had come to the shop by the
yew path—the path that runs beneath the trailing
yews and winds in and out like a purple-brown
ribbon near the spring, where the moss
is downy and green, and the bracken is high, and
the breeze makes a sibilant sound in the rushes.
I straightened my shoulders, laid aside my plane,
and rolled down my sleeves. Thus far I had not
fully appraised my visitor, having fallen a prey
to the creeping paralysis of shyness at my first
glance, but now, grown bolder, I stole a hardier
look at her face. I saw the scarlet lips, the
brilliant eyes, and the ivory forehead beneath the
midnight hair. I saw the rose tint on her cheek,
the tan on her tender throat where the rolled-back
collar left it bare. I saw—and I breathed:
“God help me!” deep in my heart; and there
must have crept a warmth that was disquieting
into my gaze, for she lowered her eyes swiftly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
and slid her hand, in its riding glove, caressingly
along the smooth surface of the cedar chest
between us.</p>

<p>“What beautiful wood,” she said softly.
“You are a carpenter—a craftsman,” she
amended. “How wonderful to work with wood
like this.”</p>

<p>“Christ was a carpenter,” a voice—a wee voice
announced from behind us. Joey had stolen into
the shop through the rear window as was his custom,
and curled up on my work bench among the
shavings.</p>

<p>“Who told you, lad?” I queried, being used to
Joey’s terse and unexpected utterances.</p>

<p>My wonder woman looked at him sharply.
Her black brows came together as she surveyed
him, and she did not smile. Joey stared and
stared at her, until I thought he never would have
done, and she continued to scrutinize him. I saw
her eyes wander over his attire. Poor lad—his
collection of wearing apparel was motley enough—an
old hunting coat of mine that almost covered
him, a pair of trousers unmistakably cut over, a
straw hat that was set down so far on his brown
head that his ears had perforce to bear the weight;
a faded shirt, and scuffed out shoes. But Joey’s
scrutiny was more persistent than the one accorded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
him, and presently, my wonder woman
was tricked into speech.</p>

<p>“Well?” she murmured, her lips relaxing.</p>

<p>Joey gave a great sigh, kicked up his heels like
a fractious colt, and rolled over among the shavings.
“Gracious Lord!” was his comment, delivered
in awed tones.</p>

<p>“Joey!” I gasped, turning. But Joey was
slipping, feet first, through the window. I
caught him by the trousers and gave him a surreptitious
shake, as I lowered him wriggling to
the ground. He rolled over, rose to his knees;
his brown eyes, big and soft, looked up at me
affectionately; his lips parted in a grin of understanding.</p>

<p>“I’ll put the potatoes on, Mr. David,” he
vouchsafed, and vanished.</p>

<p>The beautiful face was questioning when I
turned back. “Mr. David,” she repeated. “He
is not your boy then?”</p>

<p>I hesitated. “No,” I said slowly. Somehow,
I was in no mood to tell her Joey’s story at that
moment.</p>

<p>“Joey has the manners of a young Indian,” I
apologized. “I hope he did not annoy you.”</p>

<p>“Children never annoy me,” she replied.</p>

<p>A tiny dimple played at one corner of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
mouth and died suddenly as the half smile left her
face. She bent her riding-whip between her
hands and a look of distress came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am wrong, then, about this place being for
sale? I saw a sign-board back there on the road.
It said ‘For Sale’ in bold black letters. There
was a big hand that pointed this way.”</p>

<p>A light broke in on me.</p>

<p>“It must be Russell’s old ranch on Hidden
Lake,” I said. “To be sure, that is for sale. It
has been for sale ever since I can remember.”</p>

<p>I saw her eyes brighten.</p>

<p>“There is a place I can buy, then? What is it
like—this Hidden Lake?”</p>

<p>“It is a mere pond, hidden in the thickets. It
can be reached from the river. If you can find
the lead you can pole in with a canoe. It’s a
famous place for ducks. The tules almost fill
it in summer. There’s a good spring on the
place, and I guess the soil is fair. One could
raise vegetables and berries.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to raise anything.”</p>

<p>I fancied her lip curled.</p>

<p>“No—no—why, I dare say not! How stupid
of me,” I murmured.</p>

<p>She flirted her whip impatiently.</p>

<p>“Is there a road I can take?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“I will show you,” I replied, and she walked
out of the shop as if anxious to be off.</p>

<p>She paused in the cedar thicket beyond, and I
joined her. We could see the river shining like
silver gauze through the green latticed walls of
the grove, and the sky above the steeples of the
trees was amethyst and gray. The sun was low
in the west, and the shadows lay purple along the
wood aisles.</p>

<p>It was a magical May day. Hawthorn and
serviceberry bushes waved snowy arms along the
river bank and dropped white petals in the
stream, the birch trees dangled long festoons of
moss above the water, balm o’ Gileads shed their
pungent perfume abroad, and the honeysuckle
and wild clematis hung from the limbs of the
slender young maples.</p>

<p>I held aside the underbrush for my wonder
woman that she might pass, and we went through
the cedar thicket, threaded our way through
aspens and buck brush, and reached the trailing
yews that were bending to dip their shining
prisms in the spring.</p>

<p>“This is the yew path,” I explained, breaking
the silence that we had maintained since leaving
the shop. “It winds through the meadow and
joins a trail that skirts Nigger Head mountain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
Follow the trail, and it will take you to Hidden
Lake.”</p>

<p>The soft neighing of a horse interrupted me.
I peered through the buck brush, and glimpsed
a bay mare tethered to the meadow bars. My
companion gave a soft chirrup and pushed on
before me. She had the mare’s bridle in her
hand, and was stroking the animal’s nose when I
reached her side.</p>

<p>I said, “Allow me,” and offered my hand for
her foot. She glanced at my hand, looked into
my face, and smiled slowly as if amused. I felt
the hot blood mount to my brow, and then her
foot pressed my palm, and she was in the saddle,
and her mare was wheeling.</p>

<p>“Good Sonia,” I heard her murmur, and saw
her gauntleted hand steal along the arching neck.
She bent to me. The grace of her supple figure,
the vital alluring face, her baffling beautiful eyes,
her ripe lips with their dimpled corners, were
sweet as life to me. For a moment our eyes met.
She said gratefully: “Thank you. My ride
will be splendid beneath those whispering yews.”</p>

<p>Of a sudden my hands grew cold, my tongue
stiffened in my throat, and my eyes smarted.
She was going. I had no power to detain her,
no sophisticated words to cajole her. I stared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
after her, and saw her ride away through the
swaying meadow-grass to the yew path, the sun
dappling her blue riding skirt, and the breeze
lifting and swaying her bonny tresses.</p>

<p>When I went indoors after a retrospective
half hour beside the spring, I found Joey in the
grip of intense excitement. The table in the
front room was laid for three, there was a roaring
fire in the kitchen stove, and Joey’s face was
crimson as he stood on a stool at the sink turning
the boiling water off a kettle of potatoes.</p>

<p>“I’ve made squatty biscuits like you showed
me once,” he volunteered in a loud whisper, “and
stewed apples. And, Mr. David—I’ve hung a
clean towel over the wash-bench, and scoured the
basin with rushes.”</p>

<p>I looked at Joey. Out in the woods I had
undergone a savage battle with my old self that
had walked out of the shadows and confronted
me. I had remembered things—submerged,
well-forgotten things; I had exhumed skeletons
from their charnel house—skeletons long buried;
I had seen faces I had no wish to see, heard
voices, the music of whose tones I could not sustain
with equanimity; I had suffered. But as I
looked at Joey, the futile little friend who loved
me, and saw his pitiful efforts to please, the ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
went out of my heart, and the fever out of my
brain. I turned aside to the window and stood
looking out with tightening throat.</p>

<p>Joey came and hovered near my elbow.</p>

<p>“There are only two pieces of gingerbread,
Mr. David. I’ve put them on, and you can just
say you don’t believe in giving children sweets.”</p>

<p>I laid my arm across the lad’s shoulders. I
looked down into the honest brown eyes seeking
mine for approval. The pressure of the two
small rough hands on my arm was comforting.</p>

<p>“You’re a splendid provider, Joey,” I cried.
“But you may eat your gingerbread, my boy.
There will be no guest. She has gone on to
Hidden Lake.”</p>

<p>Joey looked aghast. His jaw dropped, and
his eyes grew black with disappointment.</p>

<p>“And I’ve sweetened the apple sauce with
white sugar, and gone and wasted all that butter
in those biscuits!”</p>

<p>I strolled into the front room and viewed the
preparations. There was a large bunch of lupine
in the big blue bowl in the center of the table,
and all our best china was set forth in brave
array. The bread-board I had carved graced
one end of the table; at the other, Joey had
arranged the two thick slabs of gingerbread on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
pressed glass comport, a paper napkin beneath.
I was smiling as I stood there, but I had an uncomfortable
feeling that all was not well with
Joey. A sound from the kitchen attracted me.
I went toward it. Joey leaned across the sink,
his face buried in the roller towel. His young
shoulders were heaving.</p>

<p>“I wanted her—oh, I wanted her to stay!” he
blubbered.</p>

<p>I knew not what to say to comfort my lad, and
so I said nothing. I caught up the pail and went
outside to the spring for water.</p>

<p>I had filled my pail and was stooping to gather
a handful of cress when I heard the sharp click
of wheels in the underbrush behind me. Some
one was driving over the uneven ground that lay
between the cabin and the workshop. I looked
around. A girl sitting beneath a pink-lined,
green umbrella, in a two-wheeled cart, waved her
whip at me. I straightened up, dropped the
cress, and ran through the buck brush after her.</p>

<p>“Wait, wait, Wanza,” I cried.</p>

<p>I heard her say: “Whoa, Rosebud!” And
the buckskin pony she was driving curveted and
pawed the ground and set the green paper
rosettes on its harness bobbing coquettishly as
she pulled it up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Were you coming to the cabin, Wanza?” I
asked, as I reached the cart.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Rosebud! No, I wasn’t to-night, Mr.
Dale—I was only taking a short cut through
your field.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_022.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“I WAS ONLY TAKING A SHORT CUT”</p>

<p>She leaned out from beneath the shadow of her
pink-lined umbrella and smiled at me. Seldom
it was that Wanza smiled at me like that.
Friends we were—friends of years’ standing—but
Wanza was chary of her smiles where I was
concerned, and I must confess I found her
frowns piquant enough.</p>

<p>The day that passed without Wanza whistling
from her peddler’s cart at my door seemed more
cheerless than usual. Wanza peddled everything,
from shoe laces to linen dusters. She was
the apple of her father’s eye, the pride of the
village, and the delight of the steamboat men on
the river. Ever since I had known her she had
been her father’s housekeeper. Her mother had
died when Wanza was a baby. And she and her
father lived alone in a funny little house, flanked
by a funny little garden, on the edge of the
village.</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I cried eagerly, “come in to supper
with Joey and me.”</p>

<p>I looked up at her pleadingly. Her charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
elf-face continued to smile down at me. She
shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>“Please,” I begged.</p>

<p>Gradually the smile left her face, a shrewd
look replaced it.</p>

<p>“I can make you a cake,” she began hesitatingly,
“if you’ve got any brown sugar in the
cabin.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want you to bake for us, Wanza—we
have a good meal laid out, and we want you
to honor us by sharing it.”</p>

<p>“Glory! Is that it, Mr. David Dale? Well,
I’ll stay. Not,” she added quickly, “that I
wouldn’t be too tickled to make you a cake,
only—”</p>

<p>“Only—Wanza?”</p>

<p>“Only it’s great to be invited, with all the supper
ready before hand and waiting—it sure is!”</p>

<p>“You usually earn your supper with us, girl,”
I said, as we walked toward the cabin. “There
is no one can bake such cakes as yours, and as for
your cherry pies—well, I have no words!”</p>

<p>She tossed her head. And then catching sight
of a long-tailed chat, tumbling and rollicking
above a hawthorn thicket, she stopped, her head
poised high, her delicate subtle chin lifted, her
expression rapt. All unconscious of my eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
she began making a funny little noise in her
throat:</p>

<p>“Crr—crr—whrr—tr—tr—tr—”</p>

<p>It was pure felicity to look at Wanza Lyttle
as she stood thus. She wore a gown of pink
cotton, and her tangled maize-colored hair was
looped back from her face with a knot of vivid
rose-pink ribbon. Her wide-brimmed beribboned
hat hung on her shoulders. Her collar
was rolled away from a throat of milk. Her
sleeves were tucked up, exposing brown, slender
arms. Her feet were encased in white stockings
and sandals. She was a picturesque, daring
figure. And her face!—it was like a flame in a
lamp of marble.</p>

<p>Her father, old Griffith Lyttle, was fond of
dilating on the beauty of his daughter to me.
Once he said: “She do be the prettiest young
gal astepping—but, man, I reckon she’ll see
trouble with that face o’ hers. It’s the face as
goes with a hot temper.” Looking at her now
it was difficult to associate anything but loveliness
of disposition with her face, which seemed
at this moment fairly angelic.</p>

<p>“The chat has a variety of songs, Wanza,” I
ventured. “He is laughing at you. Unless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
you can caw like a crow, and mew like a cat, and
bark like a dog you can’t attract him.”</p>

<p>“I like him because he is so bouncing and
jolly,” the girl answered. “I like bouncing,
jolly people, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>We walked on to the cabin. When we entered
the kitchen and Joey saw us, he gave a
shout of joy.</p>

<p>“Now, I’d liever have Wanza to supper than
the other woman, Mr. David,” he vouchsafed.
“I like the other woman, course I do, but I ain’t
used of her yet.”</p>

<p>I refrained from meeting Wanza’s eyes. I
went to the stove and took the biscuits from the
oven with assiduous care. But when we were
seated at the table, Wanza in the post of honor
at the head, she leaned across the battered tea-things,
rapped smartly on the table to attract
my attention and demanded:</p>

<p>“What woman did Joey mean by ‘the other
woman,’ Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>I coughed. “Why—er—only a strange lady
who stopped at the workshop to enquire if this
place were for sale. She saw Russell’s old sign
at the crossroads, and, as she explained, thought
the hand pointed to Cedar Dale.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>Wanza looked at me intently; an interesting
gleam came into her big eyes.</p>

<p>“What sort of a looking person was she, Mr.
Dale?”</p>

<p>I reached out, helped myself to a biscuit,
spread it with butter, and answered with assumed
nonchalance:</p>

<p>“Oh—so so! She went on to Hidden Lake,
following my directions.”</p>

<p>Happening to glance across at Joey I surprised
a peculiar expression on his face. I saw
astonishment written there and a look almost of
chagrin in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. David,” he burst forth, “I been
thinking sure she was our wonder—”</p>

<p>I saved the situation by springing from my
seat and pointing out of the window. “Look,
look, Wanza and Joey! There is a willow
goldfinch on that little spruce tree yonder. See
his yellow body, his black wings and tail! Isn’t
he very like a canary? I heard his song this
afternoon—I told you, did I not, lad? Hm!—he
has the most charming song—sweet as his disposition.
And his flight is wonderfully graceful!—the
poetry of motion.”</p>

<p>When we went back to our seats I was careful
to steer the conversation into safer channels.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>That night at bed-time, Joey confidentially
said to me:</p>

<p>“I won’t tell Wanza that the new woman is
our wonder woman—’cause she mightn’t like it.
Anyhow, is she any more of a wonder woman
than Wanza, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>It took me many months to answer that question
satisfactorily to myself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>HAIDEE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE, years ago, when I was a lad, in an
old volume of poems in my father’s
library I came across a steel engraving
of a beautiful woman. She had a small head
with raven black tresses bound smoothly about
her brow with a fillet, but twisted back over her
ears and ending in ringlets over her shoulders.
She had big dark eyes, a tiny mouth, a slim white
throat, and infinitesimally small hands and feet.
Her name was Haidee. I think her feet fascinated
me most; for she wore shoes unlike any I
had ever seen, ending in high curving points at
the toes. She was a most distracting, elusive
personality.</p>

<p>When my wonder woman placed her foot in
my palm, and mounted her mare at my meadow
bars, to myself I muttered: “Haidee.” So, the
following morning, in answer to Joey’s query:
“What’s her name, Mr. David?” I answered
“Haidee,” and grinned at the lad sheepishly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
through the smoke that arose from the griddle
I was greasing with bacon rind.</p>

<p>Joey, giving the cake batter in the yellow
pitcher furtive sly dabs with the iron spoon when
he thought me unaware, looked grave.</p>

<p>“It don’t sound nice. It sounds like that
name you say sometimes—”</p>

<p>“Ssh!”</p>

<p>“When you’re mad,” finished Joey adroitly.</p>

<p>I shoved the stove lid into place beneath the
hot griddle, and motioned to Joey to bring the
yellow pitcher. While I poured out the foamy
batter, Joey kept silence, watching the sizzling
process with fascinated eyes, but when I took
the pancake-turner in hand and opened the
window to let the smoke escape, he spoke again:</p>

<p>“It’s bad for her, ain’t it, having a name like
that?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t her real name, Joey. It’s a name I
bestowed upon her. It seemed to belong to her
someway. We shall never see her again, so it
does not matter.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see her again, Mr. David, if she buys
Russell’s old ranch.”</p>

<p>I paused midway to the table, the cake-turner
heaped with steaming cakes in my hand. I
stared at Joey. Curiously I’d forgotten the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
possibility of Haidee becoming my neighbor.
My wrist trembled, the cakes slipped to the floor.
Joey pounced upon them, bore them to the sink
and rinsed them painstakingly in the pail of
fresh spring water.</p>

<p>“I like cold cakes,” he was saying manfully,
when I awoke to the situation.</p>

<p>“So does the collie. No, no, lad—we may not
be living in affluence, but we don’t have to
economize on corn cakes.” I laughed boisterously
and patted his shoulder. “My cedar
chests are selling, and my book—my nature
story—is almost completed—why, soon we shall
be turning up our noses at flapjacks!”</p>

<p>“At flapjacks!” Joey cried incredulously,
making a dash for the yellow pitcher.</p>

<p>We were half through breakfast before he
spoke again, and then he ventured tentatively:
“Suppose she’ll come to-day?”</p>

<p>“Who, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Her—the—woman. The one that made me
swear when I saw her in the workshop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d forgotten your behaviour in the shop,
Joey! It was reprehensible—it was rude—”</p>

<p>Joey nodded. “I forgot I was a human
bein’.”</p>

<p>He put his elbows on the table, sunk his chin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
in his hands, and regarded me. I raised my
coffee-cup hurriedly, drained the contents, and
coughed spasmodically, Joey’s eyes widening
in concern.</p>

<p>Two days after this conversation with Joey,
as, butterfly-net in hand, I was crossing the
ploughed field back of the cabin at noon returning
from a collecting trip, I saw the bent figure
of a man approaching along the river road. He
carried a sack of flour on his back and he walked
with his head so far forward that his chin almost
touched his knees. I was feeling particularly
jubilant, having taken four Electas, six Zerenes
and two specimens of Breuner’s Silver-spot, and
I accosted him lustily: “Good day, Lundquist.”</p>

<p>He attempted to straighten up, found the
effort of no avail, and nodded. I rested on the
bars and he came slowly toward me. His red
face was so knotted and twisted that his very
eyes seemed warped askew beneath his ugly
freckled forehead. His old hands were horny
and purple-veined, his legs spindling and bowed.
Poor old derelict! Hapless, hard old man!
He lived high up on Nigger Head mountain
alone with the birds and squirrels. How he subsisted
was a mystery. But he always had
tobacco to smoke, and a corn-cob pipe to smoke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
it in. This fact comforted me, when I fell to
musing on his meagre estate.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine day, Lundquist,” I continued.</p>

<p>He came closer, halted, and peered up at me.</p>

<p>“Ya, it ban.”</p>

<p>“Been to town?”</p>

<p>“Ya—I been to town.” He took his old black
pipe from his mouth and crept closer. “Last
night,” he stuttered, in his rasping broken accent,
“last night I saw a light, Mr. Dale—a
light—down thar.”</p>

<p>He pointed with his pipe-stem over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“A light? Do you mean you saw a light from
your cabin?”</p>

<p>“Ya—in the old shack on Hidden Lake.”
He chuckled. “Thar been no light thar fer three
year. The wood-rats they eat up the furniture
ole Russell leave. Place sold—maybe?”</p>

<p>I saw Joey watching me miserably during
dinner. I ate like an automaton, and never once
did I speak. Afterward it was no better. I
took my book and sat on a bench outside the
cabin. Joey’s voice soaring high above the rattle
of the dishes in the sink; a red-shafted flicker
hammering noisily on a pine tree before the door,
saluting me with his “kee-yer, kee-yer”; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
whistle of the Georgie Oaks at the draw-bridge,
were all heard as in a dream. I was back in the
workshop with Haidee, I heard her eager question:
“There is a place I may buy, then?” I
tried to picture to myself Russell’s old cabin
metamorphosed by that radiant presence. It required
a daring stretch of the imagination to
vision anything so improbable.</p>

<p>The valley which lies like an emerald-green
jewel in the very lap of the mountains in this
section of Idaho, is watered by innumerable
streams which it seems presumptuous to call
rivers, and honeycombed with tiny blue lakes,
their entrance from the rivers so concealed by
tangles of birches and high green thickets and
clumps of underbrush that their existence is practically
unknown, save to the settlers along the
adjacent rivers and to a few zealous sportsmen
who make portages from lake to lake, dragging
their canoes across the intervening marshes and
of the Georgie Oaks likens the shadowy St. Joe
and the equally shadowy but more obscure Cœur
meadow-land. The tourist sitting on the deck
d’Alene river to the Rhine, and bemoans the
absence of storied castles, never dreaming of the
chain of jeweled lakes that lies just beyond.</p>

<p>It was on the most cleverly hidden of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
lakes that Russell’s cabin stood. Years before
I had paddled down the river and contrived to
find the lead. But the thickets were still deeper
now, and I doubted my ability to find the narrow
aperture. Toward the middle of the afternoon,
therefore, I threw the saddle on Buttons, and
rode away beneath the fragrant yews, seeking the
trail that skirted the mountain.</p>

<p>The day was fair, the sky a soft azure, and
the wheat fields rippled in a sultry breeze; but
as I left the trail and descended through a
boscage of cedars and scrub pines, following the
damp clay path to Hidden Lake, I shivered in
spite of the warmth of the day. And when I
rode through the rushes that grew as high as a
man’s head, and emerged on the cozy grey beach,
and gazed across the deep blue, unnatural quiet
of the water, I was weighted down by a weird
depression. I felt suddenly like a puny thing,
shaken with the knowledge of my own mutability.
A bittern rose up from the tules, flapped its
wings and gave its honking note of desolation; a
flock of terns on a piece of driftwood emitted
raucous cries. Russell’s cabin stood before me,
weather-beaten, warped, and unsightly; moss on
the roof, bricks falling from the chimney, the
door steps rotted, the small porch sagging.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>I slid off my cayuse and stood contemplating
the ravages about me. Not a sound came from
the cabin. Presently, I gathered my courage
sufficiently to mount the steps and knock with
the butt of my whip on the slatternly door that
stood ajar. I received no response. I waited.
The bittern in the tules gave its pumping call,
“pumper-lunk, pumper-lunk,” and the hollow
rushes droned suddenly in the wind like ghoulish
piccolos. I pushed open the door without
further ado and looked within.</p>

<p>I saw a small room, dust-covered and cob-web
frescoed. The floor was littered with refuse, the
fireplace held a bank of gray ashes, the home-made
furniture had fallen a prey to the savage
onslaughts of wood-rats. A damp and disagreeable
odor permeated the air. “Surely she has
not been here,” I said to myself.</p>

<p>I stepped to a door at the further end of the
room, turned the wobbly knob, peered within,
and shrank back, confounded at what I saw.</p>

<p>The light was streaming in through a window
that had been recently washed and polished until
it shown, over a floor freshly scoured. A small
white-draped dressing table with all a woman’s
dainty toilet paraphernalia met my prying eyes;
a small cot gleamed fresh and spotless in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
corner; and on every chair, and ranged on the
floor around the room, were canvases of various
sizes with tantalizing impressionistic bits of the
outdoor world painted upon them, while streaming
from an open trunk and overflowing in
sumptuous, foamy sensuousness to the crude pine
floor was the lingerie of a fastidious woman.</p>

<p>I took myself out of the house post-haste,
threw myself into my saddle, and plunged away
into the enveloping shadows of the cedar thicket.
That night I climbed up Nigger Head almost to
old Lundquist’s very door. I cast my eyes down
in the direction of Hidden Lake. I saw a small
red light gleaming there. I lay down on a ledge
of rock and watched the light, watched it until
toward midnight it disappeared, the wind came
up with a soughing sound, the tall pines creaked
and swayed above my head, and I walked down
the mountain—the rain in my face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>I FELL SOME TREES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALL night the rain pelted furiously
against my window, and the wind blew
a hurricane, roaring in the pine trees,
maundering in my chimney, and rattling the
loose casements. In the morning the rain had
ceased. The sky was massed with black clouds,
but streaks of blue glimmered here and there, and
there was a glorious rainbow.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. David,” Joey shouted, hanging on
my arm as I opened the front door, “the sky
looks like a Bible picture!” But I was thinking
of Haidee and wondering how she had borne the
storm, alone on the shore of that black melancholy
lake, through all the devastating night. A
huge pine tree lay uprooted across the path, the
serviceberry bushes were stripped bare of bloom,
and a cottonwood growing on the river bank
sprawled, a shattered giant, bathing its silver
head in the water.</p>

<p>I evaded Joey, slipped around to the tool-shed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and taking my ax and crosscut saw, mounted my
cayuse and rode stealthily away. When I got
within sight of the cabin on Hidden Lake, I
looked around me fearfully. Smoke was coming
from the chimney, and the cabin seemed unscathed.
And then I saw that one of the towering
pine trees in the draw adjacent had fallen,
and in falling had barely grazed the lean-to.
The cabin had miraculously escaped.</p>

<p>I rode around to the rear of the cabin and
knocked with my whip on the closed door. A
figure rose up suddenly out of the bracken by
the spring and came to my horse’s head. A
figure in a crumpled red cape, with big startled
tired eyes, and pale cheeks.</p>

<p>“I have come to cut down every tree that endangers
the cabin,” I announced grimly.</p>

<p>She looked at me, brushed her disordered hair
back from her eyes, attempted to speak, and failing,
dropped her head forward against the
horse’s neck and stood with face hidden.</p>

<p>“I came as soon as I could,” I continued,
brooding above the wonderful bent head with its
heavy ringlets of hair.</p>

<p>A sound unintelligible answered me. I sat
there awkwardly, scarcely knowing what was expected
of me. Presently she moved, looked up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
at me, and smiled. Her purple-black eyes were
dewy. Standing there in her jaunty cape and
short skirt, with her opulent hair unbound and
sweeping her shoulders, she might have been a
timid schoolgirl; and suddenly I lost my awe of
her, though my admiration deepened.</p>

<p>“Were you alone through all that brute of a
storm?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I got off my horse, and she took the bridle
from my hand.</p>

<p>“I shall have to get a woman to stay with me,”
she said slowly.</p>

<p>“An elderly woman?”</p>

<p>“No! No! A young woman—a strapping
country girl with boisterous spirits,” she protested,
an odd husky catch in her voice.</p>

<p>I revolved this in my mind. “Wanza Lyttle
is the very one for you,” I declared jubilantly.
Then I added uncertainly: “That is, if she will
come.”</p>

<p>“And who is Wanza Lyttle?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Wanza is a wonderful girl,” I answered,
warming to my part. “She drives a peddler’s
cart. I’ve no doubt she will call on you. There
never was such a peddler’s cart as Wanza’s, I’ll
give you my word. It has a green umbrella with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
a pink lining, and two green wheels with pink
spokes, and Wanza’s buckskin pony is never
without a green paper rosette for his harness—”</p>

<p>“You’re not telling me much about Wanza,
after all,” Haidee interrupted, opening her velvet
eyes wide, and favoring me with an odd glance.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I am, I am going on to tell you that
Wanza lined the green umbrella herself, and
painted her cart. She is very capable. She
makes cherry pies that melt in your mouth.
And her tatting!—you should see her tatting.”</p>

<p>“It’s on all her dresses, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“It is. And her dresses are pink and starchy.
Yes,” I ended, “Wanza is very capable, indeed—”
I hesitated. It was awkward not knowing
what to call my wonder woman.</p>

<p>“My name is Judith Batterly,” she said quietly,
seeing my hesitation—“Mrs. Batterly. I am a
widow.”</p>

<p>A turbulent tide of crimson swept up to her
brow as she spoke. Her eyes sought the ground.
There was a silence. The sun had forsaken its
nest of feathery clouds and all the shy woodland
things began to prink and preen. A flycatcher
ruffled its olive plumage on an old stump in the
spring, a blue jay jargoned stridently. Above
our heads tiny butterflies floated—an iridescent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
turquoise cloud. A fragrant steam arose from
the damp earth.</p>

<p>As the sound of my trusty ax rang through
the woods, and I chopped and sawed with a will
all through the morning, I asked myself what it
mattered to me whether Haidee were maid, wife
or widow. I asked myself this, over and over
again, and I did not answer my own question.</p>

<p>By noon I was hot, streaming with perspiration,
and covered with chips and sawdust. I was
inspecting a symmetrical, soaring white fir-tree
that towered some fifty feet distant from the
cabin, when a voice behind me cried: “No, no!”
so peremptorily, that I started.</p>

<p>I turned to see Haidee standing there. She
had looped up the masses of her black hair, and
discarded the scarlet cape for a white corduroy
jacket. A white duck skirt gave her an immaculate
appearance.</p>

<p>“I want that fir left,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Your cabin is in jeopardy while it stands,”
I assured her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll take the risk,” she said carelessly.</p>

<p>“It is foolish to take a risk,” I countered.</p>

<p>She smiled. “Are all woodsmen as cautious as
you?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Now, I am convinced she was only bantering
me, but I chose to take offense. I looked at her
cool daintiness, and met her level gaze with shifting
sullen eyes. I was unpleasantly aware of
the figure I presented, with my grimy hands
and soiled clothing, and red, streaming face.
I reached for my handkerchief, remembered
that I had lent it to Joey, and used the back
of my hand, instead, to wipe my beaded forehead.</p>

<p>“It is sometimes fortunate for the new-comer
that we woodsmen are before-handed,” I said
pointedly.</p>

<p>At this, a stain of carmine crept into the flawless
face. Resentment deepened in her eyes.
“Thank you for your morning’s work, my man,”
she said, as if to an inferior. “How much do I
owe you?”</p>

<p>A vast slow anger shook me. I saw her
through hot eyes. I did not answer. She lifted
her shoulders with a forebearing shrug, and
tendered me a coin on a palm that was like a
pink rose petal. I snatched at the coin. I sent
it spinning into the buck brush. And I turned
on my heel.</p>

<p>“When you want that tree felled, send for old
Lundquist back on Nigger Head. He’s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
man you want,” I growled, jerking my thumb
over my shoulder.</p>

<p>By the time I reached Cedar Dale, I was overcome
with chagrin and remorse at my uncouth
behavior. The more so, when on dismounting I
turned Buttons over to Joey’s eager hands; for
in the saddle-bag Joey discovered a small flat
parcel addressed: “To the boy who goes to
Sunday School.” The parcel contained peppermints
of a kind Joey had never encountered before,
and a gaily striped Windsor tie between the
leaves of a book of rhymes.</p>

<p>Each night after that I climbed Nigger Head
and lay on my ledge of basaltic rock and watched
the light down on Hidden Lake. Each time the
wind came up in the night, I turned uneasily on
my pillow and thought of Haidee alone in that
ramshackle cabin. And I worried not a little
over that white fir that towered there, sentinel
like, but menacing her safety.</p>

<p>Joey surprised me one day with the information
that he had been to Hidden Lake.</p>

<p>“I took Jingles—the collie. Jingles carried
the basket,” he added.</p>

<p>“What basket?” I asked sharply, looking up
from the flute I was making for Joey out of a
bit of elder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“The basket with the strawberries.”</p>

<p>I knew of course they were berries from my
vines, that were unusually flourishing for that
season of the year, but I continued:</p>

<p>“What strawberries, Joey?”</p>

<p>Joey’s honest eyes never wavered. He smiled
at me, pursed his lips, and attempted a whistle.</p>

<p>“I’m most sure I saw a little brown owl fly out
of a hole in the ground last night, Mr. David,”
he ventured, giving over the whistling after a
time. “Do owls burrow in holes—like rabbits?”</p>

<p>“What strawberries, Joey?” I repeated perseveringly.</p>

<p>“Our strawberries—mine and yours. I put
green salmon berry leaves in the basket. Jingles
carried it so careful! Never spilled a berry.”</p>

<p>I stroked the shaggy head at my knee. “He’s
a good old fuss pup. Aren’t you, Jingles?”</p>

<p>“That’s what she said, Mr. David. I sat on
her porch a whole hour. She asked the most
questions.” Joey reflected. “People always
ask boys questions.”</p>

<p>“Do they, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Gracious—goodness! I should say so! She
asked me what I was agoing to be when I grow
up. I told her—” Joey came over to my knee
and stroked the flute in my hand caressingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“What did you tell her, boy?”</p>

<p>“I told her,” he took his hand away and looked
at me slyly, “I told her I was agoing to be a
fixing man like you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>WANZA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WANZA,” I asked, “how would you
like to earn some money?”</p>

<p>Wanza’s big child eyes looked
at me from beneath the curls that tumbled distractingly
about her fair face.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dale,” she said solemnly, “I earn six
dollars a week with my cart.”</p>

<p>We were sitting on the river bank in the shade
of some cottonwoods, having met at the village
post-office. We had met at three o’clock, and it
was close onto five when I propounded my query.
I admitted to myself, when I put the question,
that I had been philandering. But there was
not a swain in the village of Roselake who did
not philander with Wanza. And Wanza, gay,
quick-tempered, happy-hearted Wanza—who
knew if she were as guileless as she seemed with
her frank camaraderie?</p>

<p>“To be sure you do,” I answered her, lying
back on the soft green turf and lazily watching
the skimming clouds high above the terre verte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
steeples of the pines, “to be sure you do. But
how would you like to earn thirty dollars a
month—and still drive your cart?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Dale,” Wanza returned, solemnly as before,
“it can’t be done.”</p>

<p>Her eyes had grown bigger and brighter, and
she rocked forward, clasping her hands over her
knees. I did not reply to this assertion, and
after a pause she spoke one word, still hugging
her knees and keeping her cornflower blue eyes
fixed steadily on the river. “How?”</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I asked, “did you know Russell’s
old ranch on Hidden Lake had been sold?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“A lady has bought it. And this lady wants
a companion—some one young and lively. I
think she would pay you well for being—er—lively.
And I am almost sure she would not
object to the peddler’s cart, if you would give up
your evenings to her—”</p>

<p>Wanza spoke abruptly. “No! Oh, no! No,
indeed!” she declared.</p>

<p>I was puzzled. “Why,” I said, “I thought
the plan a capital one.”</p>

<p>“But it isn’t. Just think of it, Mr. Dale.
Daddy at home alone every evening, and me—all
smugged up, asetting there on one side of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
kitchen table—her on the other—me asewing,
and her aknitting and asleeping in her chair.
Oh, I think I have a large sized picture of myself
doing it.”</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I began tactfully, “how old do you
think the lady is?”</p>

<p>Wanza’s lips drew down, and she shook her
head.</p>

<p>“She is not old,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“But I hate rich ladies when they’re middle-aged,
Mr. Dale. A rich woman, middle-aged, is
as bad as a poor one when she’s terrible, squeezy
old. The rich one’ll want tea and toast in bed,
and a fire in her bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “I can’t vouch for the lady’s
personal habits, but I’m quite certain she won’t
nod over her knitting, and I shouldn’t call her
middle-aged, Wanza.”</p>

<p>Wanza looked suddenly suspicious. “Is she
the lady as came to your workshop, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wanza.”</p>

<p>“How old would you say she was?”</p>

<p>“Not over twenty-six.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-six.” A suspicious glint darkened
Wanza’s blue eyes. “Pretty?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>The eyes glowered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>“Thirty a month would be a help, now, Wanza,
wouldn’t it?” I wheedled.</p>

<p>Wanza threw out both arms, dropped back on
the grass and lay with closed eyes. Presently
she murmured faintly: “Did you say thirty a
month?”</p>

<p>“I said thirty a month,” I repeated firmly.</p>

<p>One eye opened. Wanza kicked a pine cone
into the river, opened the other eye, and stared
at the tips of her copper-toed shoes fixedly.</p>

<p>“Thirty a month added to twenty-four—Mm!
I could go to school next year, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“You could.”</p>

<p>“I could learn how to talk.”</p>

<p>“How to talk correctly,” I amended.</p>

<p>“That’s what I meant. Well, it all depends.”</p>

<p>“On what, Wanza?”</p>

<p>“On her. If she’s a certain kind, I can’t go—if
she isn’t, I can.”</p>

<p>“It sounds simple,” I decided.</p>

<p>We were silent for a time. I lay back with
half closed eyes, watching a king-bird that had a
nest in a cottonwood tree on the bank hard by.
Presently Wanza spoke lazily:</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of those Dotted Blue butterflies
hovering about, Mr. Dale—the gay little busy
things—they look like flowers with wings.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>I unclosed my eyes and looked at the azure
cloud before us.</p>

<p>“Those are the Acmon, girl. See the orange-red
band on the hind wings. Look closely.
The Dotted Blue have a dusky purplish
band.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I don’t seem to learn very fast.
But I’m getting to know the birds, and I do
know heaps about the wild flowers. I never saw
such big daisies as I saw to-day in the meadow
back of our house—I don’t suppose you call them
daisies—and a yellow-throat has a nest among
’em. Yes! Oh, the meadow looks like a snow
field! I been watching the daisies—they close
up at night, tight.”</p>

<p>“And they open with the dawn. Daisies are
not very common in the west. I must have a
look at your snow field.”</p>

<p>Wanza’s luxuriant hair of richest maize color
was spread out in sheeny wealth over the pillow
of pine needles on which her head rested. I
reached out negligently and separated a long curl
from its fellows. “How silky and fine it is,” I
commented. Wanza lay motionless. “It would
be wonderful—washed,” I murmured, half to
myself.</p>

<p>Wanza kicked another pine cone into the river.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Plenty of soap and a thorough rinsing,” I
continued musingly.</p>

<p>“Let it alone,” Wanza commanded crossly,
her light brows coming together over stormy
eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” I said teasingly. “My fingers are
rough, and it clings.”</p>

<p>Wanza sat up quickly, cried “Ouch!” and the
next instant I received a stinging slap on the
cheek. I caught her by the elbows, got to my
feet, and pulled her up beside me.</p>

<p>“I think I won’t recommend you to the lady
who has bought Russell’s old ranch, after all,”
I taunted. “She wouldn’t want a virago.”</p>

<p>She gave a smothered sound and put her head
down suddenly into the crook of her arm, and I
felt that she was weeping. I looked down at the
sunny hair straying in beautiful disarray over
the rough sleeve of my flannel shirt, and I
experienced a pang of self-reproach. I had
wounded her pride. I had offended grievously.
Repentantly I attempted to lift the burrowing
chin.</p>

<p>“I was only teasing, silly,” I was beginning.</p>

<p>Wanza’s head came up with an abrupt jerk,
and—she bit me—a nasty, sharp little nip on my
ingratiating finger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>THE LEAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;SEEMED to have cut myself off quite
effectually from communication with either
Haidee or Wanza. The days went by,
colorless and unlovely. And June came at last,
bringing new wonderful wild flowers, and added
tassels to the tamaracks, and browner stalks to
the elder bushes.</p>

<p>One unusually hot afternoon I sat in my canoe,
idly drifting on the shadowy river, marvelling at
the clear cut reflections, and casting an eye about
for a certain elusive break in the screen of willow
shoots and rushes. If I once paddled my craft
successfully through this meagre opening, I
knew I should find a narrow waterway that
would convey me to the shore of Hidden Lake.</p>

<p>What I should do when I reached that shore
was a matter of conjecture. But after paddling
along close to the high grass and floundering
about in the tules for an hour, I gave over my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
search, rested on my paddle, and fell into deep
thought. And my thoughts were not pleasant
ones. Like the man in the story, I realized that
at a certain hour of a certain day I had been a
fool.</p>

<p>A slight sound disturbed my reverie. I looked
ahead. A canoe came slipping along in the
shade of the willows. As I stared and stared, a
voice hailed me, a voice compelling and shrill.
Wanza sat, paddle in hand, the thick fair hair
pleached low on her brows and bound with a
crimson handkerchief, her young eyes disdainful,
her lips sulky. When she met my eyes she
frowned.</p>

<p>I swept my canoe close to hers. “Did you call
me?” I asked, with marked respect.</p>

<p>She frowned still more deeply.</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I cried, with swift cajolery,
“washed or unwashed your hair is wonderful.
It is the color of corn silk, and your eyes are
surely blue as the cornflowers. Will you forgive
my rudeness when last we met?”</p>

<p>She smiled ever so slightly and the heaviness
left her face.</p>

<p>“How is business?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve sold one whisk broom, five spools of
darning cotton, a pair of cotton socks, and three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
strings of blue glass beads, to-day,” she said
succinctly.</p>

<p>“Glass beads are the mode, then? It is shocking
how out of touch I am with the world of
fashion beyond Cedar Dale.” I smiled across
at the flushed face. “Now who among the
rancher’s wives, I wonder, could have had the
temerity to pay the price of three strings of blue
glass beads.”</p>

<p>Wanza drew her paddle from the water, giving
her head a backward toss. “And it isn’t to
ranchers’ wives or town folks I’ve been selling
the beads. It’s to the gipsies at the gipsy encampment
beyond the village.” Of a sudden
her face crumpled with an expression of sly reflection.
“A gipsy woman told my fortune too,
Mr. Dale; oh, a great fortune she told me!”</p>

<p>“What did she tell you, child?” I asked,
anxious to appear friendly and interested. “It
must have been something exceptionally good,
since you are so vastly pleased.”</p>

<p>Her light brows came together. She shook
her head until her hair spun out riotously like
fine zigzag flames about her damask cheeks. “It
was not a bit good. It was as bad as bad could
be. Hm! It made me shiver, Mr. Dale. She
said she saw,” Wanza lowered her voice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
glanced apprehensively over her shoulder at the
tree shadows, “she said she saw blood on my
hands.”</p>

<p>In spite of myself I felt myself grow cold, sitting
there with the warm sun on my back. And
I cried out angrily: “Have you no better sense
than to listen to a pack of foolish lies from the
tongue of a vagabond gipsy? I am surprised at
you, Wanza. Surprised—yes, and ashamed of
you!”</p>

<p>I dipped my paddle into the water and swung
my canoe about.</p>

<p>“Wait,” I heard a surprisingly meek voice entreat.
“I thought you was going to get me a
place with the lady as has bought Russell’s old
place. Have you forgotten, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>I rested on my paddle. “Oh, no,” I said,
airily, “I have not forgotten!”</p>

<p>“I believe you’ve been hunting for the opening
in the willows and haven’t been able to find it,
either! And here was I hoping you could help
me! I been looking for it for an hour. I was
going to see this woman at Hidden Lake, myself.
After a while when I get to a slack time with my
peddling I may take the place with her.”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence. I felt her searching
eyes on my face.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“To be sure,” I said then, “I can find the
tricksy aperture that leads to the narrow water
route that runs between this river and Hidden
Lake—”</p>

<p>Wanza interrupted me with an impish laugh.</p>

<p>“It sounds like that nursery rhyme you say to
Joey.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I went on with the air of weighing the
matter, “I can find the opening very easily, I
dare say, when I come to look for it.”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew grave. She favored me with
a ruminative glance. Presently she said:</p>

<p>“Well, go ahead—find the tricksy aperture!
I’m waiting.”</p>

<p>I propelled my canoe forward. “I shall find
the open sesame,” I boasted.</p>

<p>The gravity left her eyes; they grew starry
with mirth. She repeated gaily:</p>

<p>“Go ahead!”</p>

<p>After all it was through sheer good luck that
I found the entrance to the slight channel that
led to the lake. Wanza gave me a surprised
glance as I held aside the willow shoots lest the
branches rake her head, as her canoe slipped
through the leafy opening in the wall of high
growing greenery. My blood flowed smoothly
and deliciously through my veins as I answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
her glance and swept my canoe along close to
hers, letting the willows swing into place behind
us.</p>

<p>Oh, the secretive charm of the weaving, ribbon-like
waterway, as it glided in and out between
the high willow-fringed banks of the
meadows! Oh, the flowered border-ways past
which the curling stream ran turbidly, oily and
dark and shadow-flecked, beneath the shivering
grey-green tree arcade. Oh, the perfume of the
syringa, the pipe of mating birds, the bee droning
that made the air sensuous with sound. We
were borne along silkenly. We scarcely spoke.
We drifted thus for a time, and then the channel,
gradually widening, conveyed us through leafy
growths and over-arching green to the lake, snug
in its frame of cedars.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I stood on the crumbling
steps of the old cabin and looked up at Wanza,
where she stood, leaning against the door frame,
a waving curtain of woodbine casting delicate
shadows on her face. Glancing down and meeting
my eyes she smiled.</p>

<p>“Shall I knock?” she whispered.</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>But her knock elicited no response.</p>

<p>“I reckon she’s gone off into the woods sketching.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Old Lundquist says she sketches a lot, and
rides, and shoots at marks.”</p>

<p>My heart sank. I sat down on the top step.
Wanza seated herself on the piazza railing.
“Quiet here, isn’t it?” she said musingly. “I
think I’d like living here. It’s wild and free.
Why, the village just seems to cramp me sometimes!
What’s that funny bird making that
screeching noise, Mr. Dale? And where is
he?”</p>

<p>“In the pine tree yonder. High up on one of
the topmost branches. That’s our western
wood pewee, Wanza. Listen and you will
hear the true pewee note. He gives it occasionally.
But his customary note is a very
strident unlovely one, almost like the cry a hawk
makes—there! He is giving his pewee call,
now.”</p>

<p>We sat very still, listening. “Pewee, Pewee,”
the bird gave its sad, plaintive cry, repeatedly.</p>

<p>Presently I said: “So even as unconventional
a place as Roselake village makes you
restless, does it, Wanza?”</p>

<p>“I should say so. It’s the people—and—and
church!”</p>

<p>“Church!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>She met my eyes somberly. “Going to church
almost kills me. It does, honest. Hats do,
too.”</p>

<p>“Hats!”</p>

<p>“Thinking about ’em. Seeing ’em on other
people—in front of you—at church—knowing
they can’t afford ’em—but wishing you’d
skimped Dad a little more on his white sugar and
got a better one.”</p>

<p>I laughed outright. Her eyes continued to
meet mine broodingly.</p>

<p>“Why don’t we have church outdoors, Mr.
Dale? And why don’t we just kneel down in
our work clothes, bareheaded? I’d like to
know! The trouble with church is that we only
have it once a week and in the house. If we had
it in the woods or fields and we didn’t go dressed
up—oh, a body’d feel so much nearer to heaven!”</p>

<p>“The woods were God’s first temples,” I said
gently.</p>

<p>“I’d like to go to church in the woods, and to
school in the woods. When I am sick—even
sick-hearted—the out of doors seems to cure me,
Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“Nature is sanative,” I agreed.</p>

<p>Her eyes fired. “I love every tree and every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
shrub, and every rose and every trillium—yes,
even the weeds—yarrow ain’t so bad! It’s got a
fine nutty flavor, hasn’t it now? I love the
scarred old mountains, and I love the dew on fine
mornings, and the sky on stormy nights.”</p>

<p>“Heaven’s terrible bonfires, and the delicate
rainbow belt—the purple of the new day,” I
murmured dreamily.</p>

<p>Wanza drew her feet up beneath her gown,
and clasped her knees with her hands. Looking
across them she put a wistful question: “Does
it seem long to you since you were a little boy,
Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“Rather long,” I answered drearily.</p>

<p>“I feel still as if I was a little girl. Funny,
ain’t it? I like such wee things—flowers and
birds, and kittens and puppies.”</p>

<p>“You seem very childlike, Wanza—your mind
is like that of a child—I mean—you think like a
child.” Here I broke off, catching an indignant
flash in her eye.</p>

<p>“How do you know I think like a child? I
may act like one. And a very bad one, too, sometimes!
I don’t deny that. But my thoughts—well,
they are my own! I’d be willing sometimes
to have them child-thoughts.” She sighed
ponderously. “Hm! I have some pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
grown-up thoughts—and worries, times, when
I’m all alone.”</p>

<p>“I intended to say, Wanza girl, that you have
a young soul—students of Oriental literature
tell us that some souls are younger than others.”</p>

<p>She looked at me, frowned, bit her lip and
then said dryly: “Do they know more about it
than we do?”</p>

<p>“I think so, child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right—I don’t care! So long as I
know I’ve got a soul it’s enough for me.”</p>

<p>“There are people—do you know it, little
girl?—who doubt the existence of the soul.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Wanza turned on me so quickly that she almost
lost her balance on the piazza railing. I
repeated my remark.</p>

<p>“They don’t believe—they don’t belie—why,
David Dale, how dare you sit there and tell me
such stuff as that!”</p>

<p>“I am speaking the truth, girl.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever know any one who thought that
way? Tell me that?”</p>

<p>“Yes—one or two.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At college.”</p>

<p>“At college!” Wanza gave a quick twitter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
mirth. “Well, if they was such fools as that,
why did they waste their time trying to learn
anything.”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “I cannot answer that,
Wanza.”</p>

<p>“Why! Couldn’t they smell the flowers, and
see the birds—and hear ’em, and look up at the
stars at night?”</p>

<p>I shook my head again. “One would think so,
child.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps they never looked down at the
flowers, or up at the birds, or higher up at the
stars.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“Law!” Disgust was painted on her speaking
face. “I knew there was all kinds of people
in the world!—siwashs, and cannibals, and
heathen as never had a chance—but I never knew
before that there was educated white men who
didn’t believe folks has got souls.” She uncramped
her knees, let her feet down until they
touched the floor, and rose to her full height,
stretching her arms high over her head. Standing
thus, she raised her face and closed her eyes,
I saw her lips move.</p>

<p>Still maintaining her position she whispered
presently:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Even with my eyes shut—not being able to
see anything—I can <i>feel</i> God!”</p>

<p>And this was Wanza—simple, ignorant
Wanza! whom I aspired to teach.</p>

<p>We sat on the steps, side by side till sundown,
waiting for the mistress of the cabin to appear.
But she did not come. And in the twilight
Wanza and I paddled back through the narrow
lead, and parted where it joins the river. Her
song floated back to me as I swept along in my
canoe,—an old, old song I had often heard my
father sing:</p>

<p class="center">“Wait for me at heaven’s gate—Sweet Bell Mahone.”</p>

<p>In the east I saw the thin curve of the new
moon; the departing sun had left the west purple
and gold, the water was streaked with color. I
heard the whistle of the thrush, and the weird,
“Kildee-Kildee” of the Kildeer from the marshy
shore of the lake. The hour was rich with
charm. Old Indian legends leaped to my mind
as the fascinating “Kildee-Kildee” note continued.
I thought of myself as a little chap
listening to Leather Stocking bed-time tales told
to me by my father, while I lay watching with
charmed eyes the shadow of the acacia tree
on the opposite wall. Memories stirred. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
throat tightened. Before I could grip my
thoughts and turn them aside to safer channels,
tears rolled down my cheeks. “Dad, Dad,” I
whispered, over and over, as if he might hear
me, “anything for you—anything!”</p>

<small>CAPTAIN GRIF</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WANZA’S father had always been an
interesting personality to me. He
was a portly, ponderous-speaking
man, with a rubicund visage, a twinkling eye, and
a jovial smile. There was a humourous twist to
each sentence he turned, and this in connection
with an undeniable stutter made conversation
with him an unending source of joy.</p>

<p>He had been a sea captain in his youth. He
could spin me yarns by the hour. And many a
snug winter evening I had spent in the little
room under the eaves of his comfortable cottage,
listening to tales of the high seas, and songs of
the rolling main. His room with its slanting
ceiling, its built-in bunks, its nautical equipment
of compass and sextant, charts and logbook and
maps, smacked pleasantly of the sea; and when
the wind roared in the chimney and the snow
and sleet twanged on the window panes, I used
to shut my eyes and fancy myself aboard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
good ship <i>Wanderer</i> bound for the North Seas.</p>

<p>There was always a glass on the table, and a
bottle of home-made root beer was always forthcoming,
and though I was not over fond of this
drink a glass of it had a grateful tang, when I
drank with Old Grif Lyttle, the captain of the
bonny brig <i>Wanderer</i>, in the small cubby hole
he called his cabin.</p>

<p>The captain invariably wore a blue jacket
with brass buttons. His nether garments might
be what one would call shabby and uncouth, but
the jacket was always neatly brushed, the buttons
burnished. Wanza was like the Hebe in
Pinafore—she kept his buttons bright. And had
he owned a sword to polish I am well satisfied
it would have been immaculate. Wanza’s pride
in her father was unbounded. It was equaled
only by his pride in her.</p>

<p>“The smartest gal—and the prettiest,” he
would say, “you’ll f-find in the whole state. Jest
like her dead mother, Mr. Dale, jest like her.
Smart as a s-sand piper. Named herself—she
did. Did I ever tell you about that now?”
Here he would pause and look at me sharply.
And though the tale was a familiar one to me I
would always affect deep interest and bid him
proceed. “It was this a-way,” he would continue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
“when her mother was my sweetheart,
being of a fanciful turn, and with a decided
hankerin’ after me,—as was to be expected,
when I was gone for months on the sea and
everything uncertain like,—she called me her
wanderer. I was her wanderer, and her wandering
boy, and finally her wandering husband. So
when I got my ship at last it was natural—although
I was in favor of naming the craft after
her—for us to decide that the name should be
<i>The Wanderer</i>. In due time Wanza was born.
Well, it had been easy enough naming the ship,
but there warnt no name good enough for the
babe! ‘Let her alone,’ I used to say, ‘she’s a
s-smart child, she’ll name herself.’ And sure
enough when she was old enough to prattle she
began calling herself Wanzer, from hearing her
mother and me speak of the craft, sir. I reckon
sometimes hearing us call it endearin’ titles she
thought we was referrin’ to her babyship. At
least my wife she allowed as much. Howsoever,
from Wanzer she got it changed to Wanza, and
my wife allowed that Wanza was a genteel
enough name, so we stuck by it.”</p>

<p>The small, four-roomed cottage where Wanza
and her father lived was at the edge of the village.
It stood on a slight rise of ground, overlooking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
the lake. From the narrow front porch one
could look abroad and see fertile fields, stretches
of smooth, glossy meadow-land, and the craggy
grey-blue mountains in the distance. In summer
Grif Lyttle could be found customarily on
his porch. And it was here I discovered him,
when in my new restlessness I thought of him and
wondering how he fared, sought him out.</p>

<p>He made me welcome. His ruddy face broke
into smiles at the sight of me, and he rose from
his rocker, and shoved me, with a playful poke
in the ribs, into the seat he had vacated, saying:</p>

<p>“By golly, ship-mate, I thought you’d passed
me up for good and all.”</p>

<p>He sat down in a red-cushioned Boston rocker
opposite me. A small table stood between us,
and as he spoke he gave me a sly wink, and
whisked off a white cloth that covered a tray that
reposed there. A bottle and two glasses stood
revealed, a plate of pretzels, and one of cheese
cakes.</p>

<p>“My lunch,” he explained. “That is to say—our
lunch, boy.”</p>

<p>“But you thought I had passed you by. The
extra glass is not for the likes of me. Come now—whom
do I rob?”</p>

<p>“It’s Father O’Shan from the Mission.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
Here’s to him! He’s an hour late, and the man
who is an hour late had better not come at all.”</p>

<p>“Not if he comes for cakes and ale,” I assented,
biting into a cheese cake with relish.</p>

<p>“No—nor if he comes for nothing. Punctuality
is my hobby. Yes, it be, s-ship-mate.
There’s twice the spice to an adventure if it’s
pulled off when it should be. Cool your heels
fifteen minutes, or a half hour, waiting for the
party of the second part, and you don’t give a—ahem!—what
becomes of the expedition. Yes,
sir! the keen whet has gone if you have to wait
over long for the other fellow. That chap is a
borrowin’—no! he’s stealin’ your time. And I
don’t borrow—and I don’t like to lend—and you
can’t respect a thief. So there you are!” He
looked at me, grinned mendaciously, and continued:
“The other fellow gets the cream of the
whole adventure. He’s probably takin’ a drink
with some other old crony while you’re waitin’.”</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t apply in this case,” I reminded
him, calmly helping myself to another of
Wanza’s delicious cheese cakes.</p>

<p>“Not in this case. No, sir! Father O’Shan’s
probably been held up by some one with a long-winded
yarn of how the poor wife’s adyin’ of
consumption, and the kids of starvation. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
Father’s heart’s that s-soft he’d s-strip the coat
from his back to give it to a beggar.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I well know that. Wanza has
told me as much.”</p>

<p>“Wanza knows she hasn’t any better friends
than Father O’Shan and the sisters at the old
Mission up De Smet way.” The smiling face
lengthened, he filled his pipe from the tobacco jar
at his elbow, and tamped down the weed with a
broad forefinger. “Wanza’s a high strung girl,
Mr. Dale, she’s peppery, and she’s headstrong,
but Sister Veronica can do almost anything with
her, ay! since the time when I brought her out
to the river country with me, a poor, sick, wee,
motherless lass, pretty nigh sixteen years ago.
She’s larned all she knows of the sisters about
cooking and sewing and the like.”</p>

<p>“And we know that is considerable,” I said.</p>

<p>“She’s quite some cook, I make no doubt.
There ain’t much Wanza don’t know about a
house.”</p>

<p>“How do you manage during Wanza’s busy
season when she is absent so much in her cart?
She seems to be a very busy saleswoman these
days,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Well, the days are lonesome like. But she’s
hardly ever gone more’n a night or two at a time—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
gal never neglects her old dad. Once a
week she tidies and bakes regular. I am used
to bachin’ it too, it seems natural to cook vittles,
and sweep—jest like old times. I allow it’s
great. The most bothersome thing I have to do
nowadays is ’tendin’ the flowers. Wanza’s got
such a posy garden it sure gets to be a nuisance
some days when my joints be stiffer than common.”</p>

<p>He chuckled and waved in the direction of the
garden plot at the side of the house. “Not but
what I take a pride in it myself,” he added as he
caught my interested and not wholly unappreciative
glance.</p>

<p>To glance at Wanza’s garden was to receive a
dizzying impression of pink and white bloom,
pranked round by shining smooth rocks of uniform
size and whiteness. The flash and dazzle
of it struck blindingly on the eyes. It was
Wanza-like. I got up, descended the porch
steps, and went to the garden, the better to
inspect its glamour and richness. Rows of pink
holly-hocks, clusters of sweet William, trellises of
sweet peas, fluffy red peonies, pink and white
poppies bordering beds of tea roses breathed of
Wanza. And yet—the wild things at Cedar
Dale pleased her best, I knew.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Captain Lyttle seemed to be reading my
thoughts, for he said facetiously:</p>

<p>“It’s a fairly purty garden, to my notion, but
there ain’t anything in it as good as the swamp
laurel and lupine at Cedar Dale, accordin’ to
Wanza. She don’t hold by cultivated flowers no
more, she says. Give her the wood-flowers as
grows wild and hides away, she says. And
that reminds me, Mr. Dale, I got that bird you
give her at Christmas on my hands, too. ‘Poor
old Dad,’ she says, ‘will have him for company.
He’s mine,’ she says, ‘he’s mine. But, Dad,
what’s mine is yours.’ Meanin’ I’m to take care
’o him.” He put his hand on my shoulder.
“Come along in to Wanza’s room and have a look
at him.”</p>

<p>I was getting new side lights on Wanza’s character
to-day. Even her room was an elucidation.
It was small, with a long narrow window on the
south side and a door that opened into the garden.
The walls were bright with gay sprigged paper,
the bed was white as a snow heap, the curtain at
the window was spotless and looped with pink
ribbon. Wood-work and floor were painted
green, also the wooden bed and small dresser.
There was a green tissue paper shade on the lamp
on the table; and green paper rosettes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
wreathed around cheap prints and fastened with
gilt headed tacks to the walls. But in spite of
its tawdriness the room had a fragrance of
lavender, a nicety that was comforting. It was
a little girl’s room. Indeed, I spied a fat-faced
wax doll in one corner seated on a balloon-like
pink silk cushion; and on a shelf with an impossible
beaded lambrequin stood a Dresden-china
lamb and a wax cupid in a glass case.</p>

<p>The canary’s cage hung in the window, clouded
in folds of pink mosquito bar. But the canary
itself was on the limb of a flowering currant bush
outside the window. I chirruped to it, but it
contented itself with chirruping back, and I left
it unmolested. As I looked around the room
again my eye was arrested by a snap-shot picture
of Joey and myself framed in bark and covered
with the inevitable pink mosquito netting, standing
on a small table at the head of Wanza’s bed.
Above it on the wall hung a Christmas card I had
given Wanza, bearing Tiny Tim’s message “God
bless us every one.”</p>

<p>Grif Lyttle evinced considerable pride as he
showed me the room. His genial face beamed,
and his eyes shone as he looked about him from
the green rosettes to the beaded lambrequin and
back to me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>“Snug little nest, eh?” he hazarded. Meeting
my appraising eye his face twisted into an
odd look of whimsical interrogation. “Some
girl—what? Know any finer—ever see a prettier?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Nowhere?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Ever eat after a better cook?”</p>

<p>“Certainly I never have.”</p>

<p>“Ever expect to?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He gave his booming laugh, and led the way
to the porch.</p>

<p>“Right-o, ship-mate! Have another glass
now, and we’ll drink to the gal’s health, and finish
the cheese cakes.”</p>

<p>Passing along the main street of the village
some two hours later, I saw Father O’Shan,
climbing out of a ramshackle gig at the door of
the post-office. I went up to him and placed my
hand on his shoulder, saying:</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, Father O’Shan, I want to
confess.”</p>

<p>His fine, ascetic face turned round to me with
a wave of quick sympathy overspreading it; then
when he saw who it was who had accosted him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
he laughed, a musical, clear-timbred peal, good to
hear.</p>

<p>“I have eaten your cheese cakes,” I vouchsafed.</p>

<p>He wrung my hand. “Good! Captain Grif
doesn’t have much sympathy with the delinquent.
I fancy his comments were characteristic.” A
shadow fell athwart his face. “I was called to
the bedside of a sick man—a dying man—a homesteader.
He is dying in poverty and distress—alone—but
for me, yonder in the mountains.”</p>

<p>My mood veered suddenly. “I know the man—if
I can help,—” I began, and stumbled on;
“In like straits I may find myself, some day.”</p>

<p>I felt my shoulder pressed. “No, David Dale.
Not you! Will you walk with me a way?” he
asked abruptly.</p>

<p>I turned with him and we left the dusty street,
and took the road that bordered the river. Already
the sun was slipping behind the western
mountains, and the water ran rainbow colored,
between its high, shelving banks. Father O’Shan
took off his hat and bared his head to the breeze
that was springing up.</p>

<p>“A day for gods to stoop—ay, and men to
soar,” he quoted, favoring me with his warm
smile. “I’ve had a hard day, Dale, a hard day.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>I think I have never seen so rare a face as his.
Rugged and yet womanly sensitive and fine.
He was a man ten years my senior, I dare say,
and in his glance there was something gripping
and compelling, something at once stern and
gentle, whimsical and austere.</p>

<p>“A hard day—but you’ve been equal to it,
Father O’Shan,” I cried impulsively. “When
the day comes that I am broken in health, and old
and friendless, I shall ask for no other physician,
no truer companion, no more sympathetic assuager
of pain than you.”</p>

<p>I grinned sheepishly as I spoke, but my companion
answered earnestly:</p>

<p>“You speak as if you expected always to remain
in your small corner, Dale. If I could
prophesy I would say two years hence will not
find you here.”</p>

<p>I shook my head, and we walked on in silence
for awhile.</p>

<p>“You may marry,” he was beginning, but at
the black cloud apparent on my face he caught
himself up, saying: “I can’t believe you have no
future ahead of you, man.” He went on,
gravely: “Dale, I want to be assured that you
look upon me as a friend. We know each other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
rather well, and I think we find each other congenial.
We have had some rather interesting
arguments during our jovial evenings with
Captain Grif. At first I thought you were a
genius. But I know you better now. I have
studied you. You’re normal, splendidly balanced,
healthy, resistant. You’re clever and
plodding—you’ll make good. But you are not a
genius. I like you immensely. Certain things
I have gathered from Wanza make me feel that
at times you need a friendly hand—that you are
breasting treacherous currents, even now.
Come, Dale, I’d be your friend.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand, mine went out to meet
it and we struck palms warmly. I said then:</p>

<p>“I have not been a black sheep. It’s a shadow
on my past that keeps me here, of course. But
the story is not my own—it must be kept inviolate.
But my present troubles and ambitions
are for your ear—if you will have them. There’s
my sordid, pinching poverty—you know of that—and—I
am writing a book—”</p>

<p>He caught his lip between his teeth; his eyes
flashed at me; he appraised me.</p>

<p>“What sort of book?”</p>

<p>“A novel. A story with a strong nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
atmosphere. Someway I feel it will be a success.”</p>

<p>“Good! Success to you. Success to you—and
Wanza.”</p>

<p>“Wanza!” I cried, starting uncontrollably.
“What has she to do with it? Wanza—that
child?” I finished smilingly.</p>

<p>“A child, is she?” He came to a halt in front
of me. “David Dale, be careful in your dealings
with that child. Forgive me—I asked you to
bear me company that I might say this to you.
Be careful.”</p>

<p>“But I do not understand,” I parried.</p>

<p>He said nothing more, meeting my eyes
gravely and extending his hand. And so we
parted. And I went home and smiled to myself
over his last words as I reviewed them. No one
so well as I knew what an incorrigible child
Wanza was. I thought of the wax doll on the
pink silk cushion and was convinced.</p>

<p>Father O’Shan was the first person to whom
I had confided my ambition concerning the novel
I was engaged on. I had labored at it many
months. It was progressing satisfactorily to me.
By autumn I hoped to complete it. I had a fond
hope that Christmas would find it sold to the
publishing firm in the East to whom I proposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
to send it. If it sold—if it sold!—my plan was
to support myself and Joey by the sale of my
cedar chests and wood carvings until I could
make good in the world of literature.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>WANZA BAKES A CAKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE sunny afternoon in the following
week I again took my canoe and slipped
down the river to the small aperture in
the willows. This time I did not hesitate, but
entered the lead boldly. And I was no sooner
afloat upon the green-fringed waterway than my
temerity was rewarded. A canoe appeared
around a bend ahead of me, and in the craft sat
Haidee plying the paddle. She was almost a
dazzling vision as she approached me. She was
in white, and the shadows were green all about
her, and the ribband snood on her head was blue,
and blue flowers were heaped around her feet.
When she saw me she called out: “Have you
forgotten that you were to send me Wanza
Lyttle?” and there was an amused light in her
brilliant eyes.</p>

<p>In my confusion I stammered and was unable
to make a coherent reply, and after a quick
glance at my face, she exclaimed:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Never mind! I have seen her for myself.”</p>

<p>“You have seen her?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I rode into Roselake village this morning
and enquired right and left for Miss Lyttle.
Every one smiled and said: ‘Who? Wanza?’
Then I met her in her cart on the river road. I
knew her by the green umbrella.” Haidee
paused and ruminated, wrinkling her brows. “I
know why she lined her umbrella with pink.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I cried, disregarding the seeming
irrelevance, “is she coming to stay with you?
That’s the main thing.”</p>

<p>“She’s asked for a week or so in which to consider.
But—yes, I think she’s coming to stay
with me.”</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief. “Then that’s
settled.”</p>

<p>She went on evenly: “Now that you have
found the waterway I hope, very often, after I
have secured the services of that distracting girl
of the green umbrella—when I am lonely—and
you are lonely too—you will take your canoe and
seek us out. Not,” she amended quickly, “that
I mind my solitude. All my life I have hungered
for the quiet places. But I must confess
I have an eerie feeling—at times—on moonless
nights—and sometimes just at twilight—and always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
when a coyote howls in the night.” Her
bright face clouded, then she shrugged. “Never
mind! We all have our haunted hours. In the
daytime I am gloriously happy and carefree. I
take my mare and follow any casual, wee road I
can find. I sketch in the woods, and along the
river. I tramp too, and climb the hills. But
Sonia, my mare, and I are good company. I
have hired that funny bent man who lives back
on the mountain to take care of my mare for me.”</p>

<p>“Lundquist?” I asked, quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. He has been very neighborly,” she
replied, with a slight emphasis on the pronoun.
She smiled, meeting my eyes, and I said quickly:
“I shall be only too happy to call on you and
Wanza. I can understand how one not accustomed
to solitude would find the environs of Hidden
Lake depressing.”</p>

<p>Her face grew thoughtful. “I have been
wondering lately what attracted me so strongly
to the place. It is a drab, unlikely spot, I know.
The lake is like a black tarn at night, the dense
growth of cedars and pines is repellant, at times.
In the moonlight the trees stand up so threatening
and ghostly. And when the wind blows they
wave gaunt, bearded arms abroad as if warning
the too venturesome wayfarer against intruding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
here. I have roughhewn my life, Mr. Dale, but
I must believe some force beyond me is shaping
it. I have been fascinated against my better
judgment by Hidden Lake! I had to pitch my
tent here, for a time! I had no choice.”</p>

<p>It seemed a strange confession. All at once
a question leaped to my lips, and I spoke hurriedly:</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me something of yourself—where
your home is—your real home!”</p>

<p>“My real home?”</p>

<p>“I can picture you with surroundings better
suited to you. Even I say to myself, ‘God grant
that this be not my house and my homestead,
but decree it to be only the inn of my pain.’”</p>

<p>The quick carmine stained her cheeks. She
lifted the blue flowers and held them, plucking
nervously at the petals. Then she looked up at
me, and uttered something like a little cry of
scorn. “Why, it’s a painter’s paradise—in spite
of the loneliness that abounds! Can’t you see
that?”</p>

<p>“I can see that, of course,” I answered.</p>

<p>“And I am an artist. So you are answered.
Years ago, with my father, who had mining interests
in this section, I spent one whole summer
on the Swiftwater, painting. Since then I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
hungered to get back to this adorable river country.
I have always wanted a painting retreat in
this marvelous lake-jeweled meadow-land, where
the mountains shift and merge their colors, and
the rivers have such cameo-like reflections. No
matter where I may wander,” she went on with
enthusiasm, “I shall always be glad of this place
of inspiration to work in and dream in—I don’t
look upon it as a permanent habitation, simply as
a delightful camp in the wilderness I love.”</p>

<p>Paddling home I recalled Haidee’s enthusiasm
with a smile. And then I bethought me that she
had not after all told me the slightest thing concerning
herself or any recent home.</p>

<p>Some two hours later as I bent over the stove
in the kitchen, intent on frying some thick slices
of cornmeal mush for Joey’s supper, I heard the
whir and grind of wheels and the creaking of harness
through the open window. I glanced out.
A buckskin pony and two-wheeled cart were
skirting the ploughed field and approaching the
cabin. I glimpsed a familiar figure beneath the
pink glow of the lining of the green umbrella.
When the buckskin pony was near enough for me
to see the green paper rosettes on its harness, I
called out to Joey, who was laying the table in
the front room:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“Put on another plate, lad. Wanza is coming.”</p>

<p>Something was amiss with Joey. His face
had displayed unmistakable signs of perturbation
during the day, and there was something infinitely
pathetic about the droop of his brown
head, usually held so gallantly. I had thought
best to disregard his melancholy attitude, knowing
that bed-time would bring an unburdening
of his heart. In response to my announcement,
he gave a fairly frenzied shriek of joy.</p>

<p>“Good—ee!” he shouted, with such a clatter of
hob nails as he crossed to the cupboard that I
could picture in my mind the jig steps that carried
him thither. “There’s a wee bit of molasses
in the jug,” he called to me, “I was saving it for
taffy—you said I might. I’ll just put it on.
And the spring is ’most full of cress, Mr. David,—I’ll
scoot out and get a panful before she gets
here.”</p>

<p>He was off like a flash through the kitchen to
the spring as Wanza entered by the front door.</p>

<p>I went to meet her. I found her standing in
the centre of the living room. The door was
open behind her, and her hair was like a pale
silver flame in the light. As I drew near to her
I saw that her cheeks were splashed with crimson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
her eyes dark with some tempestuous stress of
feeling. There was something unfriendly in her
bearing. But I held out my hand and cried
blithely:</p>

<p>“You are just in time to have a bite of supper
with us, Wanza. We heard the rattle of your
cart, and Joey has gone to the spring for cress.”</p>

<p>She met my glance dourly. Her brows came
together and she ignored my outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. David Dale,” she said with great dignity,
“perhaps I am wrong, but it’s my opinion you’ve
forgotten what day it is.”</p>

<p>I smiled into the sullen face. “Oh, no,” I said
airily, “I have not forgotten! To-day is wash
day—therefore Monday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and whose birthday is it, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>I stared at her.</p>

<p>“Whose birthday, whose? Just his—his—as
never had a birthday that’s known of! Except
that you vowed he should keep a day for his own
every year, and named a day for him, which I
thought you meant to keep sacred as Christmas,
’most.”</p>

<p>A light dawned on me. Some years before
Wanza and I had decided that Joey must keep
one day each year as his birthday, and I had
dedicated the fifth of June to my little lad; planning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
to keep each fifth of June as if it were
indeed the anniversary of his birth, as it was the
anniversary of his coming to me. A week since
I had bethought me of this, yes, even yesterday
I had remembered it. But to-day I had visited
a charmed spot, I had seen a radiant being, I had
listened to a seraphic voice—I had forgotten. I
hung my head.</p>

<p>Wanza spoke again. “The poor boy,” she
said, “poor Joey!” There was a break in her
accusing tones. “I didn’t think that you’d be
the one to forget him, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of it, Wanza,” I confessed.
My heart turned heavy within me. I felt a
traitor to my trusting lad who would never in his
most opulent moment have forgotten me. “I am
heartily ashamed of it,” I repeated.</p>

<p>After an uncomfortable pause I ventured to
raise my eyes from the floor. I saw then that
Wanza’s arms were filled with mysterious
weighty looking bundles. As I would have
taken them from her she shook her head, then
nodded in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>“You’ve got a good fire going, I see. Let’s
get busy! Split up some good dry wood. I
want a hot oven in ten minutes. I’ve brought
raisins and spices and brown sugar—I’ll stir up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
a birthday cake. And as for you—” she paused
in her progress kitchenward to favor me with an
ominous frown—“as for you, Mr. David Dale,
don’t let that boy know you went and forgot his
birthday or—or I’ll never speak to you again.”</p>

<p>She passed on to the kitchen and I seized the
ax and betook myself to the chopping block. I
had just laid my hand on a piece of resinous wood
when I heard a joyous confused babble of
tongues in the kitchen I had quitted. Joey had
entered by the front door and shouted Wanza’s
name gleefully. And then I heard:</p>

<p>“Bless your old heart! Have you a birthday
kiss for Wanza? Well I am late getting round
this birthday—I usually come at noon, don’t I,
Joey?—but better late than never! It’s getting
too hot to eat in the middle of the day. We
thought—Mr. Dale and me—that we would
change the doings this year. We didn’t want
you to imagine, Master Joey, that we couldn’t
think up anything new for your celebration.
We ’lowed as how you were getting a big boy
now, and would like more grown-up doings.”</p>

<p>Joey responded chivalrously:</p>

<p>“You’re terrible good to me, Wanza. I like
any doings, ’most. I’ll remember this birthday
forever and ever, I know. Why, it’s been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
funniest birthday! Mr. David has been on the
river ’most all afternoon. I was ’most sure he’d
forgot what day it was. But soon as I heard
your cart, Wanza, I knew what it was—a surprise
party! Like folks give ministers. And
that was why Mr. David would not let on. I
guess not many boys have spice cake on their
birthday, and can help bake it, too.”</p>

<p>I heard the sound of a kiss, and Wanza saying
in a choked voice:</p>

<p>“There’s a bit of store candy in that brown
paper sack, Joey. My, the heat of the oven
smarts my eyes! See, Joey! You can stone the
raisins for me while I beat the eggs for the frosting.”</p>

<p>“Of course Mr. David wouldn’t forget my
birthday,” I heard my loyal lad resume as I stole
forward to the door with my armful of wood,
“I’m ’bout the same as his boy, ain’t I, Wanza?”</p>

<p>I swung open the door, and dropping my load
of wood to the floor, cried cheerily:</p>

<p>“Here’s the wood to cook the boy’s birthday
supper, Wanza. Come and give me a hug, Joey.
I think you’re old enough to have a few nickels
to spend, boy,—put your hand in my pocket, the
pocket where we keep our jack-knife. There!
What do you find?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“A dollar,” shrieked Joey with bulging eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s yours,” I said.</p>

<p>His eyes opened wide, gazed incredulously into
mine; his face grew white; and then tears gushed
forth. “And I thought—I thought you’d forgot
my birthday,” he sobbed.</p>

<p>Wanza’s nose was pink when I turned to hold
the oven door open for her. But her eyes were
friendly, and her full, exquisite lips were smiling.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a perfectly grand cake,” she
breathed.</p>

<p>Joey had run whooping out of doors to bathe
his face in the spring. Emboldened by the girl’s
smile I touched her smooth round cheek lightly.</p>

<p>“There’s a tear here still, Wanza,” I teased,
though my voice was somewhat husky. “You’re
April’s lady—sunshine and shadow—tears and
laughter; but you’re a good girl, Wanza, a fine
staunch friend to Joey and me. Don’t hold my
thoughtlessness of to-day against me, please.”</p>

<p>She dashed the drop away. Her cornflower
blue eyes blazed suddenly into mine.</p>

<p>“I ’most hated you a little while ago, Mr.
David Dale, when I knew why you’d forgotten
poor Joey’s birthday—” she hesitated, then repeated
defiantly, “when I knew why you’d forgotten.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Now,” I said, challenging her, “I defy you to
say why I forgot the lad’s birthday.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you why. Because you’re thinking
so much about the woman as has taken old
Russell’s cabin you haven’t got time to remember
other folks. Old Lundquist says you watch her
light o’ nights from Nigger Head.”</p>

<p>“Lundquist is a meddlesome, prying old idiot,”
I cried angrily.</p>

<p>Seeing me aroused, Wanza’s anger cooled. “I
dare say he is,” she admitted, as she stepped
to the oven door. “Why should you be taken
with a creature like her, I should like to know!
Such a flabby, white-faced, helpless moon-calf.”</p>

<p>She laughed, shut the oven door, straightened
her fine shoulders and went to the window to cool
her cheeks. I looked at her as she stood there,
I saw her smile and wave her hand to Joey, who
was performing sundry ablutions at the spring.
She was wearing a collarless pink cotton frock,
spotless and fresh as water and starch and
fastidious ironing could make it; her face was as
ardent as a flame, her eyes glowed deep and impassioned,
her lips were smooth as red rose petals.
Her mop of fine, blond curls was massed like a
web of silk about her colorful face. I looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
her with appreciation. But as I looked I sighed.
Hearing my sigh she gave me an odd glance, then
crossed the room and stood before me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dale,” she said soberly, “I am sorry I
told you what old Lundquist said. I allow
you’ve a right to watch a light on Hidden Lake
if you’ve a mind to. Look ahere, do you want
I should go and stay with her?”</p>

<p>“Why,” I replied, “I think it would be kind,
Wanza.”</p>

<p>She bit her lip, shot a keen glance at me, and
said shortly:</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go, as soon as I have done my own
house cleaning.”</p>

<p>“You’re a good girl, Wanza,” I said again.</p>

<p>She turned from me, sniffing the air. “That
cake’s about done, I’ll warrant. Call Joey, Mr.
Dale, and I’ll put the mush on the table, and see
to the icing.”</p>

<p>Somehow the meal did not pass off with the
degree of festivity I had hoped for. Wanza
watched me from under her thick lashes in a most
disconcerting manner as we chatted desultorily,
and my little lad was unusually silent. I felt
that I had not atoned to Joey for the long,
arduous day through which he had passed, that its
memory lay like a shadow over the present gala<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
hour. To lighten it in some measure I ventured
a proposal.</p>

<p>“Joey,” I said, speaking abruptly as a silence
threatened to engulf us, “how would you like to
go gipsying with me for a few days?”</p>

<p>“Gipsying,” Joey repeated. His face was
illumined as he caught my eye and partially
sensed my meaning. “Does gipsying mean
living in a covered wagon, Mr. David, and cooking
bacon on sticks over a camp fire?”</p>

<p>I nodded. “All that and more, Joey. It
means wonderful things, lad. It means faring
forth into the greenwood in a caravan in the
rosy dawn of a summer day, finding the most
alluring trail that leads to the most secretive of
trout streams, lounging in the shade of spreading
trees at noon time, eating a snack of bread and
cheese, poring over a treasured book for an hour
while you drowse back half dreaming to all the
pleasant happenings of your youth. Then when
it’s cooler faring on again, till the sun begins to
drop behind the mountains and hunger seizes you
by the throat—”</p>

<p>I broke off, catching sight of Joey’s rapt face.
It was radiant and eager and wistful all at once.</p>

<p>“Mr. David,” he said, pushing back his plate,
“let’s go!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“If you don’t go after saying what you’ve just
said—” Wanza shook her head at me, and left
her sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>“I could not have found it in my heart to paint
such a picture, Wanza girl,” I replied, “had I
not intended to give Joey the opportunity to
compare it with the reality. We will stretch the
old tarpaulin over the ranch wagon in the morning,
stow away some bacon and cornmeal and a
frying pan, harness Buttons to the caravan, and
go out into the greenwood to tilt a lance with
fortune.”</p>

<p>I laughed as I spoke; but a weariness of spirit
that I had been struggling all the evening to
combat lay heavily upon me. Well, would it be
for me, I said to myself, to get away from Cedar
Dale for a few days. I had felt an impelling
hunger to see my wonder woman again; I had
been restless for days consumed with the hunger;
now I had seen her, and a new strange pain had
been born to replace the former craving. I was
in worse stress than before.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>GIPSYING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was into the sunshine of a cloudless June
morning that Joey and I fared in quest of
adventure. Our caravan was well provisioned
with necessities, well equipped with
cooking utensils, stocked liberally with fishing
tackle. And with a lively rattle and bang—we
rolled out on to the river road and wheeled away
at a goodly pace. I held the reins and Joey
alternately piped on his flute and sang a lusty
song about a “Quack with a feather on his back.”</p>

<p>Despite the depression that obsessed me my
spirits rose as we went on, and by noon when we
were well into the heart of the deep lush woods
beyond Roselake, I am sure Joey could have had
no cause to complain of the gravity of his companion.
Surely there is balm for wounded souls
in the solitude of the greenwood. We found a
spot where bracken waved waist high, where moss
was green-gold and flowers were sprouting on
rocks, where the very air was dreamful. I felt a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
sudden electrification. My feet felt young and
winged again; I lost all desires, all hopes, all
fears; I only realized that I was unweighted. In
this meeting with nature I was stripped and unhampered—unexpectedly
free from the dragging
bondage of the past few days.</p>

<p>We were on the mountain side, and waters
poured down into the valley below us, waters that
hinted of trout. Heights were to left and right
of us, the sky stretched azure-blue between, all
about us were sequestered nooks where singing
brooks played in and out among the green
thickets.</p>

<p>“Shall we camp here, Joey,” I asked, marking
the satisfaction on his face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. David, I was ’most afraid to ask!
Seems as if we hadn’t gone far enough. I should
think gipsies would camp near trout streams,
though.”</p>

<p>He was already lifting our cooking kit from
the caravan, his small brown face alert, his stout
little hands trembling with their eagerness to assist
in the unloading. We gave an hour to making
camp. I built a fire between two flat stones,
and Joey filled a kettle with water and placed
it over the blaze, while I put my trout rod together,
chose a fly carefully from my meagre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
home-made assortment and went to the near-by
stream.</p>

<p>I whipped the stream carefully for half an
hour and succeeded in landing a half dozen trout.
They made a meal fit for a king. And afterward
Joey and I lay on the grass half dozing and
watching a pair of violet-green swallows that
had a nest in a hole in a cottonwood tree on the
bank of the stream.</p>

<p>“Don’t they like bird houses?” asked the small
boy.</p>

<p>“They do,” I replied. “They will welcome
almost any tiny opening. They will go through
a hole in any gable or cornice. They are industrious
and painstaking; they have courage and
patience. It is fine to have courage and patience,
Joey.” I was almost asleep, but thought it well
to point a moral while I had his ear.</p>

<p>“What can you do with those two things, Mr.
David, dear?”</p>

<p>“Almost anything, lad.” I thought of Santa
Teresa’s book-mark: “Patient endurance attaineth
to all things,” and I clenched my hands
involuntarily, and sat up.</p>

<p>“I see—it’s going to be a story!”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “It’s warm for stories.
Try to rest, Joey.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>He lay back obediently, and a hand stole out
and stroked my hand.</p>

<p>“But, what, Mr. David—what can you do with
courage and patience?”</p>

<p>The question came again, and found me still
unprepared.</p>

<p>“What would you say, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Well,” the clear, light tones ran on, “if you
have patience you can make things—like cedar
chests and tables and bird houses; you can fix
things too—same as you do, Mr. David. Fixing
is harder than making, I guess. ’Most anybody
can make things—perhaps—I don’t know for
sure; but everybody can’t fix things, like you
can.”</p>

<p>I gripped the small hand hard.</p>

<p>“What about courage, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! that’s for fighting lions and—and
coyotes. Every big man can kill lions. I’d
liever fix boys’ toys.”</p>

<p>I dozed after a time, and from a doze drifted
into refreshing slumber. I awoke to see silver
shadows drawing in around me, overhead a half-lit
crescent moon, tender colors streaking the
mountains. There was an appetizing smell of
cooking on the air, and casting my eyes about I
spied Joey very red-faced and stealthy, kneeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
beside the camp fire, holding a forked stick in
his hand on which was impaled a generous strip
of sizzling bacon. I saw a pan of well-browned
potatoes hard by, and I rose on my elbow prepared
to shout “Grub-pile,” after the fashion of
camp cooks, when I heard a strange, sibilant
sound from a clump of aspens on the other side
of the stream.</p>

<p>I listened. Tinkle, tinkle went the stream;
swish, swish whispered the aspens and young
maples; but surely that was a human voice droning
a curious, lazy chant. I fixed my eyes on the
aspen thicket. Presently there came a strange
rustling, a vague movement beyond the leafy
screen. I waited. Soon a brown hand parted
the branches, two bright eyes peered through.
As I rose to my feet a slight wiry figure in the
fantastic garb of a gipsy darted from the bushes,
leaped the stream, and sprang into the little clearing
by the fire. I saw a brown face, poppy red
lips, and a pair of dancing eyes, shadowed by hair
black as midnight. I bent a sharp scrutiny upon
the intruder as she stood there in the uncertain
light, but with a petulant movement she drew the
peaked scarlet cap she wore lower over her face,
and wrapped the long folds of her voluminous
cape more closely about her.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“Let the gipsy cook your bacon,” she said in
an odd throaty voice to Joey.</p>

<p>Joey with big-eyed wonder relinquished the
forked stick and dripping bacon strip, and the
gipsy tossed back her cape, freeing her arms, and
began a deft manipulation of the primitive implement,
turning it round and round, now plunging
it almost into the heart of the fire, now drawing
it away and waving it just beyond the reach of
the leaping flames. When I drew near with the
coffee pot in my hand, and essayed another glance
at her face, it was too dark for me to see her
features plainly. I had only a dizzying glimpse
of wonderful liquid orbs, white teeth and
wreathed berry-red lips.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE GYPSY TOSSED BACK HER CAPE</p>

<p>When the meal was ready she ate ravenously,
almost snatching at the food with which Joey
plied her. The light from the fire played over
her picturesque attire, shone in her eyes and
danced on the tawdry ornaments she wore. She
had seated herself with her back against a log;
her cape had fallen away, disclosing a coarse
white blouse and short skirt of green; about her
slim waist she wore a sash of red. In her ears
were hoops of gold; each time she tossed her head
they danced riotously; and with every movement
of her brown arms the bracelets on her wrists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
jangled. I glanced at her suspiciously from time
to time. But Joey’s delight was beyond bounds.
He was so frankly overjoyed at the gipsy’s
presence that once or twice he giggled outright
when she looked at him. I saw an answering
flash in her eyes. Of speech she was chary, and
all my efforts to draw her into conversation were
futile.</p>

<p>She made no attempt to assist Joey and me
with the clearing away of the remains of the repast,
watching us from under sleepy lids without
changing her position against the log; but when
we came back to the fire after our work was
finished, and I stretched out with a luxurious
yawn, she smiled at me and mumbled:</p>

<p>“The poor gipsy girl can tell your fortune.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’re a Romany,” I said
sharply, “you’re much too good looking, and too
clean.”</p>

<p>She drew back, resentment in her bearing, and
I made haste to placate her by saying:</p>

<p>“The fact is, I have had my fortune told so
often by gipsies in the vicinity of Roselake that
there is no novelty in it.”</p>

<p>She frowned, and I asked, trying to speak
pleasantly, “Where is your encampment?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>She pointed towards the West. “There!
Way off,” she grunted.</p>

<p>We sat for a long while in silence. The darkness
was like a glorious, blurred, mist-hung web,
closing in beyond the circle of light cast by our
camp fire. The crescent moon shone palely, but
the stars were like crimson fires in the nest of
night. There was a smell of honey on the wind,
a pungency of pine, a mingling of mellow odors;
and over all this the cleanness of the woods that
was like a tonic.</p>

<p>Joey yawned finally, his head fell over heavily
against my arm, and I said, “Bed-time, Joey!”</p>

<p>“As for me,” the gipsy muttered, rolling over
with an indolent, cat-like movement on the soft
moss, “I sleep here. This is a good bed. You
sleep in the wagon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Good! The encampment is far away. I will
not go through the woods to-night. Not me.”
She covered her face with her cape. I heard a
prodigious yawn. “Good night,” she said, in a
muffled tone.</p>

<p>I stowed Joey away on a bed of hemlock
boughs in the wagon, and after I had satisfied
myself that he slept, I returned to the fire. I
knelt beside the shrouded figure.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Wanza Lyttle,” I said sternly, “uncover your
face and look at me.”</p>

<p>She kicked out ruthlessly with both copper-toed
shoes, wriggled angrily beneath her cape,
and then lay quiet.</p>

<p>“Do you think, Wanza, you should have followed
us in this shameless fashion,—and in this
disguise?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why I shouldn’t, if I wanted to,”
a surly voice replied from the folds of the cape.</p>

<p>“You are always doing inconceivable, silly
things,” I went on. “How did you get here?”</p>

<p>“I followed you on horseback. Rosebud is
tethered a ways back in the woods.”</p>

<p>“What will your father say to this? What
will the entire village say when the busybodies
learn of it?”</p>

<p>“Father isn’t at home; he’s at Harrison. As
for the others,—” Wanza sat up, and cast the
cape from her—“little I care for their talk.”</p>

<p>“I wish you cared more for public opinion,
Wanza.”</p>

<p>“Public fiddlesticks,” Wanza growled, crossly.</p>

<p>Suddenly she laughed with childlike naïveté,
her eyes grew bright with roguery.</p>

<p>“You did not know me just at first, now did
you? The black wig, and staining my face and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
hands fooled you all right for awhile. Don’t I
look like a gipsy? I did it to please Joey—partly—and
partly because—oh, Mr. Dale, I
wanted to come with you! It sounded so fine—what
you said about the greenwood and the caravan.
Do you hate me for following?”</p>

<p>What could I say?</p>

<p>I made her as comfortable as I could there on
the soft moss, with a couple of blankets, heaped
fresh wood on the fire, and then I crawled in beside
Joey and lay pondering on this latest prank
of madcap Wanza. I saw the moon grow
brighter and pass from my vision, I saw the stars
wheel down the sky towards the west, and dawn
come up like a delicate mincing lady, and then
I slept.</p>

<p>Joey stood beside me when I awakened. He
had a scarlet ribbon in his hand.</p>

<p>“The gipsy’s gone, Mr. David,” he said. “I
found this hanging on an elder bush.”</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of thankfulness.</p>

<p>“So she’s gone,” I murmured, not venturing to
meet his eyes.</p>

<p>“She was a beautiful gipsy,” he continued regretfully.
“Do you know, Mr. David, I think
she was almost—not quite—but almost as pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
as Wanza. I guess there never was any one
prettier than Wanza, ’cept—” he hesitated.</p>

<p>“Yes, Joey? Except?”</p>

<p>“Is the wonder woman prettier?” He put the
question wistfully.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not—I do not know, Joey.” Could
I say in truth she was? remembering the face I
had seen in the firelight.</p>

<p>But that night after Joey was tucked away in
the covered wagon the gipsy came again. I
raised my eyes from the fire to see her coming
through the long grass toward me. She came
springing along, her bare arms thrusting back
the low hanging tree branches, her short skirt
swirling above her bare feet.</p>

<p>I went to meet her. Her manner was bashful,
and her eyes were imploring. And after I had
greeted her she was tongue-tied.</p>

<p>“Now that you are here, come to the fire,” I
said.</p>

<p>She shrank from me like a tristful child.</p>

<p>“Come,” I said. “And tell me why you have
come back.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t come back—exactly. I have been
in the woods all day near here.”</p>

<p>“Why have you done this?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>She hung her head and looked up from under
her curtain of hair.</p>

<p>I threw a fresh log on the fire and she seated
herself. I stood looking down at her half in
anger, half in dismay.</p>

<p>“Are you hungry? Have you eaten to-day?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“I have all the food I need in the saddle bags.”</p>

<p>I seated myself then, and as there seemed
nothing more to say I was silent. But I looked
at her in deep perplexity from time to time. She
was flushed, and her eyes were burning. Her
hair was tangled about her neck and veiled her
bosom. She faced me, wide-eyed and silent.</p>

<p>It was deeply dark in the hill-hollows by now,
but the sky was a lighter tone, and the stars
seemed to burn more brightly than usual. There
was no faintest stirring of wind. The silence
was intense, bated, you could feel it, vibrating
about you. The trees were heavy black masses,
shadowing us. I heard a coyote yelp away off
on some distant hill side, and the sound but made
the ensuing silence more pronounced.</p>

<p>Presently Wanza spoke: “I wish I was a real
gipsy,” she said. Her tone was subdued, there
was something softened and wistful in it. “All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
day long I have had the time I’ve always wanted,
to do nothing in. I waded in the spring. I slept
hours in the shade. I drank milk and ate bread.
I bought the milk at a ranch house way up on the
side of the mountain. Glory! It was great! I
hadn’t a single dish to wash. It’s all right when
you’re rich—everything is, I guess. But when
you’re squeezy poor and uneducated and of no
account, and you’re housekeeper and peddler and
Lord knows what! You don’t get no chance to
have a good time. Now, do you, Mr. David
Dale?”</p>

<p>Her words aroused me somewhat rudely from
a reverie into which I had drifted, so that I
answered abstractedly: “Perhaps not, girl.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t. What chance do I get?”
She stared fixedly at the fire. “I have to work,
work, work, when all the time I feel like kicking
up my heels like a colt in a pasture.” There was
a strained, uneven quality in her tone that was
foreign to it. I saw that she was terribly in
earnest.</p>

<p>“A gipsy’s life isn’t all play, Wanza. It’s all
right in poetry! And it’s all right for a gipsy.
But Wanza Lyttle is better off in her peddler’s
cart.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d just like to try it for awhile!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>I remembered a song I had heard in Spokane—at
Davenport’s roof garden—on a rare occasion
when an artist chap who had spent some
weeks at my shack had insisted on putting me up
for a day or two while I visited the art shops in
the city. It was a haunting thing, with a flowing
happy lilt. I had been unable to forget it,
and without thinking now, I sang it.</p>

<p>“Go on,” Wanza breathed tensely, as I paused.</p>

<p>“Have you never heard it?”</p>

<p>“Never!”</p>

<p>“Is there more?” Wanza queried as I again
paused.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! It’s rather long.” I bent forward
and gave the fire a poke. “That’s about enough

<p>Wanza was very silent as I finished. I felt
strangely silent, too, and weighted with a slight
melancholy. But the singing of the song had
put an end to Wanza’s plaint. Her face had lost
its peevish lines and grown normal again. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
fire burned low, a wind came up from the west
and blew the ashes in our faces, there was a weird
groaning from the pine trees. The quiet of the
night had changed to unrest, overhead the sky
had grown darker, the stars brighter. We continued
to sit side by side in brooding quiet, until
the fire had burnt its heart out, and the air became
more chill, and drowsiness began to tug at
our eyelids.</p>

<p>I arose then. “Light of my tent,” I said with
gay camaraderie, “I will bring the blankets from
the wagon for you, and since you are to sleep
here you may as well stay and breakfast with
Joey and me.”</p>

<p>She looked up at me oddly, sitting cross-legged
close to the fire, the light spraying over her dusky
carmined cheeks. “Say the words of that gipsy
thing again,” she urged.</p>

<p>“I can’t sing any more to-night, girl.”</p>

<p>“Don’t sing—say the words.”</p>

<p>The evening had been so frictionless, that I
made haste to comply with this very modest demand;
but when I came to the last verse I
stumbled, and in spite of myself my voice softened
and fired at the witchery of the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Marna with the wind’s will,</div>
<div class="verse">Daughter of the sea!</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
<div class="verse">Marna of the quick disdain,</div>
<div class="verse">Starting at the dream of stain!</div>
<div class="verse">At a smile with love aglow,</div>
<div class="verse">At a frown a statued woe,</div>
<div class="verse">Standing pinnacled in pain</div>
<div class="verse">Till a kiss sets free!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Wanza rose and came close to me as I finished.
Her black elf-locks brushed my shoulder. “If
I was a gipsy and you was a gipsy,” she
whispered, “things would be different.”</p>

<p>I saw her eyes. Some of the tenderness of the
last few lines of the song was in my voice as I
whispered back, “How different, child?”</p>

<p>I stood looking down at her, and her eyes—burningly
blue—sank into mine. The wind
tossed her hair out. A strand brushed my lips.
She seemed an unknown alien maid, in her disguise,
and in the shifting pink light from the low
burning fire. I took a bit of her hair in my hand
and I looked into her face curiously. I stood
thus for a long moment, catching my breath
fiercely, staring, staring—her hands held mine,
her scarf of red silk whipped my throat—how
strangely beautiful her face, the full lids, the
subtle chin, the delicate yet warm lips! Had I
ever seen as beautiful a girl-face? The soft wind
swept past us sweet with balm o’ Gilead; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
brook was awake and singing to the rushes; but
the birds were asleep, and a sweet solitude was
ours. This girl was of my world, all gipsy she,
wilder than most. And I—was I not as wide a
wanderer as any gipsy? as homeless? I smiled
into the eyes that smiled into mine, and I
hummed below my breath:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Standing pinnacled in pain</div>
<div class="verse">Till a kiss sets free!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Yes, the face of this girl was a marvelous thing,
a perfect bit of chiselling. Brow, cheeks, nose,
chin, shell-like ears—exquisitely modelled. Had
I ever looked at her before? What rare perfection
there was in her face. And her nature was
rich—rich! Her soul—</p>

<p>Ah, her soul!</p>

<p>Suddenly it was Wanza, my comrade, Joey’s
staunch friend and playmate, into whose eyes I
looked. The gipsy was gone. The glamour
was gone. Enchantment and madness were
gone. I stood by a dying fire in a wind-stirred
forest, with the roughened hands of a country
wench in mine. But though she was only a country
wench I admired and respected her. And
when she whispered again as I moved away from
the touch of her hands: “Things would be different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
if we was gipsies,” I replied: “Perhaps so,
Wanza. But we are not gipsies. So let us not
even play at gipsying.”</p>

<p>I went to the wagon for the baskets.</p>

<p>The next morning the gipsy was gone, and
that was the last I saw of her.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE BIG MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOME two weeks later Joey informed me
that he could play “Bell Brandon” on his
flute. I doubt if any one familiar with
the piece would have recognized it as rendered
by Joey on the futile instrument I had carved.
The air being unfamiliar to me I asked him where
he had picked it up.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he said carelessly, “she plays it on her
guitar.”</p>

<p>I was growing accustomed to the sight of Joey,
followed by the collie, marching sturdily away
down the yew path each day as soon as the dinner
dishes were done, and I had more than once remonstrated
with him on the frequency of his visits
to Hidden Lake. His answer was invariably the
same. “She says, ‘Come again,’ every time, Mr.
David.”</p>

<p>“That’s only a way people have of being
polite,” I protested at last, and was surprised to
see the hurt tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>That night he came home radiant.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t say ‘Come again’ to be polite,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
he announced, throwing his cap in a corner and
speaking blusteringly. “She didn’t ask Mr.
Lundquist to come again. She only said, ‘When
I need you again I’ll let you know.’”</p>

<p>The perfect weather changed about this time,
and sultry nights, alternating with days like hot
coals, ensued, until, suddenly, one evening at
dusk, the wind came up with a roar, and scurrying
leaves and particles of dust filled the air.
The dust storm enveloped us. It sang and
poured and hissed up and down the river, the
temperature kept dropping lower and lower, rain
and hail descended, and the wind grew more tempestuous
as darkness came on.</p>

<p>As I pored over a volume of Tacitus that evening,
glowing with the sense of well being that
the warmth of the fire and the cheer of the light
cast by my green-shaded light imparted in contrast
to the storm without, there came a vigorous
knocking at the cabin door.</p>

<p>Joey, dozing on his stool before the fire, sat upright
with a start, and the collie growled and
ruffled his back. A curious prescience of disaster
assailed me with that knock; a grim finger seemed
laid on my heart-strings—I seemed to feel the
touch of a cold iron hand arresting me on a well-ordered,
dearly familiar path.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>Joey sprang to the door, opened it wide, and
a gust of wind tore it from his hand. The rain
swept into the cabin, and a man carrying a suitcase
came quickly forward from the darkness
beyond, crossed the threshold, and stood in the
glare of the firelight.</p>

<p>He was a tall man, powerfully built, but he
walked with a slovenly gait, and something
pompous and hard and withal insincere rang in
his tones as he set down his suitcase and spoke:</p>

<p>“Pardon my intrusion, my man. Your light
attracted me. It’s blacker than Egypt outside,
and I’ve lost my way in the storm.”</p>

<p>He rolled back the collar of his slicker coat and
shook the raindrops from the brim of his hat.</p>

<p>“Take off your coat,” I said hospitably, “and
come up to the fire.”</p>

<p>He thanked me, favored me with a patronizing
glance from his full-lidded light eyes, and stood
rocking back and forth on the bearskin rug before
the fire, rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>“I shall have to hurry on to Roselake if I am
to get there to-night. Perhaps you will show me
the trail, my man.”</p>

<p>I assured him that I would direct him, then
realizing that the man was chilled through, I
threw a fresh log on the fire, and going to a cupboard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
in the chimney-corner, took down a bottle
and a small glass and placed them on the table.</p>

<p>“Have a drink,” I said, “it will save you from
a bad cold on a night like this.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. Don’t mind if I do.” He filled
his glass, and as he did so his glance fell on the
book I had been reading. His manner changed.
“‘Tacitus’! Rather grim reading for a wild
night like this.” He turned a page unsteadily,
and followed a line with his finger. “Mm!
Nero, the fiddler—it’s ghastly reading—bestial,
rather. Cramming for anything?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Take something lighter—‘Abbe Constantine,’
‘Hyperion,’ ‘The Snow Man.’”</p>

<p>His voice was thick; and as he stood resting
his hand on a chair back, he lurched slightly.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” I said.</p>

<p>He sank into the armchair and raised his glass,
waving it in my direction, then he rose to his feet,
bowed, and said: “Your health, sir,” and drank
thirstily. I saw then that he had been imbibing
more than was good for him, but I could also
see that he was literally sodden with fatigue, and
something impelled me to offer him food.</p>

<p>“Now that’s kind—very kind,” he said
throatily. “I could not think—” He reeled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
back against the chair and put his hand to his
head suddenly.</p>

<p>I signaled to Joey, who left the room, and I
went to the man and eased him into the depth of
the chair.</p>

<p>“Rest here awhile and have something hot to
eat,” I suggested.</p>

<p>His head sank on his chest, his lids dropped
over his prominent eyes. “Yes—‘Abbe Constantine’—or
‘Hyperion’—‘Hyperion,’ preferably,”
he mumbled. “Weak, disgusting fool—Nero!”</p>

<p>He roused sufficiently to eat a few mouthfuls
when Joey and I served him royally with good
corned-beef and hominy, and a steaming pot of
coffee. But he sank again into lethargy, and I
saw that he was in no condition to push on to
Roselake in the storm.</p>

<p>I told him so frankly, and pointed to a built-in
bunk covered with hemlock boughs in the
corner. “Turn in here,” I said, giving him a
couple of blankets. “I’ll bunk with the lad to-night.”</p>

<p>I had taken great pains with Joey’s room, and
the narrow cedar strips with which I had paneled
it shone with a silver lustre in the light of the
two candles Joey insisted on lighting in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
honor. Joey’s bed was a boxed-in affair, but I
had contrived to make it comfortable by stretching
stout bed-cord from the head to the foot and
interlacing it across from side to side. This
served in lieu of springs. The mattress was a
crude one of straw, but the straw was sweet and
clean, and Wanza had pieced a wonderful bed
quilt of shawl-flower pattern calico, and presented
it to Joey the year before when he had the
measles. The bed had a valance of blue burlap,
and I had painstakingly stenciled it with birds
and beasts and funny fat clowns and acrobatic
ladies in short skirts and tights, after a never-to-be-forgotten
circus-day parade Joey had witnessed
in the village.</p>

<p>There was a gaily striped Indian blanket for
covering, and pillows stuffed with the feathers of
many a mallard slaughtered in the marshes. I
had converted a couple of barrels into chairs and
covered them with tea matting. For floor covering
there were the skin of a mountain lion that
had prowled too close to my cabin one night,
and the skins of a couple of coyotes that had
ventured within shooting distance.</p>

<p>In one of the windows hung the wooden cage
I had made for Joey’s magpie. But the windows
themselves were my chief pride. I had procured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
them from an old house-boat that had been abandoned
by a party of fishermen, and had drifted
down the river to anchor itself before my workshop.
There were four of these windows, with
tiny mullioned panes, and I had hung them, two
on either side of a door that opened out on a
rustic pergola I had erected. The pergola led
to a bosky dell of green—a veritable bower—where
wild honeysuckle hung its bells in the sweet
syringa bushes, and wild forget-me-not and
violets and kinnikinic gemmed the emerald banks
of a limpid pool so hedged in by high green
thickets that no eye save the initiated ever rested
on its crystal clarity. We called this spot the
Dingle Dell, and the Dingle was a rare retreat
for Joey on the occasion of any embarrassing
caller.</p>

<p>As I blew out the candles that night and lay
down beside the little lad, he murmured sleepily:
“Bell Brandon ain’t so terrible hard to play on
the flute—but it’s terrible hard on a guitar; a
guitar makes blisters on your fingers.”</p>

<p>He spoke again almost unintelligibly. “I
don’t like that man. He never spoke to me once,
Mr. David. Any one, ’most, speaks to a boy.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the night I awakened. Joey
was sitting up in bed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>“A star’s out, Mr. David. I’m making a
wish,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” I yawned drowsily, “lie down—you’ll
take cold.”</p>

<p>He cuddled obediently beneath the blankets.
“I’m wishing the big man would go, but I’m wishing
you’d sleep with me just the same, Mr. David.
I sleep tighter when the coyotes holler.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>JINGLES BRINGS A MESSAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOEY did not get his wish concerning the
departure of the big man, for the next
morning the big man was in no condition
to go anywhere. He was still lying in his bunk
when I went through the room to build the
kitchen fire; and when breakfast was ready, he
had not roused even to the strains of “Bell
Brandon” played on Joey’s flute.</p>

<p>I stood over him, and he looked up at me with
lack-lustre eyes, attempted to rise and rolled back
on his pillow like a log.</p>

<p>“Morning, stranger,” he muttered. He
winked at me slyly. His face was puffy and red,
his eyes swollen, his breathing irregular and
labored. “What’s matter?” he protested thickly,
then he smiled, with a painful contortion of his
fever-seared lips, “I seem to be <i>hors de combat</i>.
Terrible pain here.” He touched his chest.</p>

<p>“I’ll get a doctor at once,” I said.</p>

<p>He thanked me, gave me a keen look, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
asked wheezingly: “Not married? No wife
about?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. “Unfortunately, no.”</p>

<p>He winked at me a second time. “<i>Lascia la
moglie e tienti donzello</i>,” he cackled.</p>

<p>I went from the room pondering on the strange
personality of this man, who was unquestionably
a scholar, and who, no doubt, considered himself
a gentleman. I dispatched Joey for a doctor.</p>

<p>“Take Buttons and ride to Roselake as fast as
you can,” I bade him. “Where’s the collie? He
may go along.”</p>

<p>Joey, basking in the sun on the back steps, laid
aside his flute. His lips drew down, and his eyes
bulged widely.</p>

<p>“The big man’s going to stay, then, Mr.
David?”</p>

<p>“Run along,” I said sharply.</p>

<p>As I let down the meadow bars, Joey turned
in his saddle and gave his clear boyish whistle.
But no Jingles answered the call, and a moment
later the lad rode away with a clouded face.</p>

<p>A few moments later, as I plied my ax at the
rear of the cabin, the cold muzzle of the collie
was thrust against my hand. I stooped to caress
him, and as he leaped up to greet me, I smiled
as my eyes caught the color and the sheen of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
silken ribbon threaded through his collar. Well,
I knew that bit of adornment—that azure fillet
that Haidee had worn in her hair.</p>

<p>I touched the inanimate thing with tender
fingers, and started suddenly to find a jeweled
pendant hanging there, glowing like a dewdrop
against the dog’s soft fur. I stood agape, feeling
my face soften as my fingers stroked the
bauble; and then I straightened up with a swift
presentiment. It was in no playful mood that
Haidee had placed that costly gewgaw about the
collie’s neck.</p>

<p>I turned toward the stable, and then remembered
that Joey had taken the horse. My only
recourse was the canoe. I ran to the willows
where the craft was secreted. I had it afloat in
a twinkling, and was paddling away down the
river, the collie barking furiously on the shore.</p>

<p>Poor pale, beautiful Haidee! She lay like a
crumpled white rose in the bracken beside the
spring. The white fir-tree that, in falling, had
crushed the lean-to of the frail cabin had swept
her beneath its branches as she bent for water at
the spring. This was the story I read for myself
as I bent above my prostrate girl. But it was
many days before I learned the whole truth.
How, close onto midnight, she had heard a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
hallooing from the lake shore; how she had stolen
out from the cabin in the storm, fearing an intrusion
from some drunken reveler from the
village tavern; how, after the tree had fallen and
pinned her fast with its cruel branches, she had
lain unconscious until with the first streak of light
she had felt the touch of the collie’s muzzle against
her face; how she had roused, and, her hands
being free, had torn the ribbon from her hair and
bound it about the collie’s neck, and, as an afterthought,
attached the pendant from her throat,
thinking the ribbon alone might not occasion surprise.</p>

<p>She told me all this, days afterward; but when
I reached her side, she was incapable of speech,
and only a flutter of her white lids denoted that
she was conscious.</p>

<p>I had a bad half hour alone there in the
bracken, watching her face grow grayer and
grayer as I worked to dislodge the branches that
were pinning her down. And, at last, as I lifted
her in my arms, I saw the last particle of color
drain from her lips, and realized that she had
fainted. But I had her in my arms, and her
heart was beating faintly. And, someway, hope
leaped up and I felt courageous and strong, as I
bore her to the river and placed her in the canoe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>Joey was kneeling among the willows with his
arms clasping Jingles as I beached my canoe near
the workshop.</p>

<p>“I knew something had happened to Bell
Brandon,” he declared, in big-eyed misery. “I
knew it! I knew it!” He took the crumpled
bit of ribbon from the dog’s neck with hands that
trembled, and came forward slowly. I was unprepared
for the look of abject misery on his
small face. “Oh, Mr. David,” he quavered,
“don’t tell me she is dead!”</p>

<p>“No, no, lad,” I said hastily, “she has only
fainted.”</p>

<p>He looked at me uncertainly, tried to smile,
and a tear dropped on the ribbon in his hands.
Then a look of joy made his face luminous.
“The doctor’s here, Mr. David. I didn’t know I
was abringing him for Bell Brandon. I thought
it was just for the big man.”</p>

<p>So Joey had a name for my wonder woman,
too. I could not but feel that his name was the
sweeter of the two.</p>

<p>I bore Haidee through the room where the
doctor was in attendance on the big man, who
was by this time raving and incoherent in his
delirium, passed swiftly through the small hallway
that separated the cedar room from the main<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
one, and laid Haidee on Joey’s bed. Then I
brought the doctor. I left Haidee in his hands,
and Joey and I passed outside to the Dingle, and
stood there silently, side by side, by the pool.</p>

<p>I saw the green mirror flecked with the white
petals of the syringa, and I heard a squirrel chattering
in the hemlock above my head, and was
conscious of a calliope humming-bird that pecked
at the wool of my sweater. But my whole soul
was in that cedar room, where Haidee lay white
and suffering, and I was repeating a prayer that
had been on my mother’s lips often when I was
a child as she had bent over me in my small bed:</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, keep my dear one! Deliver us
from murder and from sudden death—Good
Lord, deliver us!”</p>

<p>But Haidee’s condition was not serious. The
doctor came out to us, Joey and me, with the assurance,
and at once the world began to wag
evenly with me. “All she needs now is rest,” he
said suavely. “She will now be able to rest for
some time. You’d better get a woman here,
Dale, to help out. Mrs. Batterly mentioned it.
There’ll have to be a trained nurse for the man.”</p>

<p>In the workshop Joey and I considered the
situation in all its phases, and Joey sagely counseled:
“Send for Wanza.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>The suggestion seemed a wise one, so I penned
a careful note, and Joey rode away to the village
for the second time that day.</p>

<p>In my note I said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Wanza</i>:</p>

<p>I am in trouble. Mrs. Batterly has met with an
accident, and is here at my cabin, unable to be moved.
I have also a very sick man—a stranger—on my hands.
Joey and I need you—will you come?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Your old friend,</span><br />

<span class="smcap">David Dale</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Wanza responded gallantly to my call for aid.
In a couple of hours I heard the rattle of her cart
and the jingle of harness, and the sound of Buttons’
hoof-beats on the river road, and emerged
from my workshop to greet her.</p>

<p>She stepped down from the shelter of the pink-lined
umbrella, and answered my greeting with
great circumspection. I lifted down her bag and
a big bundle, Joey carried her sweater and a
white-covered basket, and together we escorted
her to the cabin and made an imposing entrance.</p>

<p>The big man, tossing about in his bunk in the
front room, ceased his confused mutterings as we
crossed the threshold, struggled up to his elbow,
stared, and pointed his finger at Wanza. “<i>La<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
beauté sans vertu est une fleur sans parfum</i>,” he
said indistinctly.</p>

<p>Wanza stared back at him, ignorant of the
import of his words; and as I frowned at him, he
threw up both hands and drifted into dribbling
incoherence. I pointed to the door at the end of
the room, and Wanza went to it swiftly, opened
it quietly, and passed through to Haidee.</p>

<p>When I went to the kitchen, after giving the
big man a spoonful of the medicine the doctor
had left, I found Joey on the floor, with his arms
about the collie’s neck.</p>

<p>“I can trust you,” he was saying, “I can trust
those eyes, those marble-est eyes! Why, if it
hadn’t been for you, Jingles, Bell Brandon could
never a let Mr. David know.”</p>

<p>The stage stopped at Cedar Dale late that
afternoon, and set down the trained nurse. And
our curious ménage was complete.</p>

<p>The nurse proved to be a sandy-haired, long-nosed
pessimist, a woman of fifty, capable, but
so sunk in pessimism that Joey’s blandishments
failed to win her, and Jingles stood on his hind
legs, and pawed his face in vain.</p>

<p>All through supper she discoursed of microbes
and the dangerous minerals in spring water.
She read us a lesson on cleanliness, repudiated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
soda in the biscuits, and looked askance at the
liberal amount of cream I took in my coffee.</p>

<p>“Cream has a deleterious effect on the liver,”
she informed me, looking down her nose sourly,
while Joey wrinkled his small face, appeared
distressed at the turn the conversation was taking,
and gasped forth:</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. David, do people have livers same
as chickens?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Olds sniffed, Wanza looked out of the
window and bit her lips, and I shook my head
at Joey.</p>

<p>“My dear Mrs. Olds,” I said cheerfully, “there
is nothing the matter with my liver, I assure you.”</p>

<p>She looked me over critically, inquired my age,
and when I told her thirty-two, remarked darkly
that I was young yet.</p>

<p>When Wanza and I were left alone in the
kitchen, I had time to observe Wanza’s hair. It
made me think of the flaxen curls on the heads
of the French dolls I had seen displayed in the
shop-windows at Christmas time. Each curl was
crisp and glossy, and hung in orderly, beauteous
exactness, and the little part in the centre of her
head was even, and white as milk. Palely as her
hair was wont to gleam, it shone still paler now,
until in some lights it was almost of silvery fairness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
and indescribable sheen. Beneath it, her
blue eyes looked almost black, her complexion
had the rare whiteness of alabaster. There could
be no two opinions on the subject—Wanza had
washed her hair.</p>

<p>I knocked together a crude cot covered with a
bit of canvas, on which Mrs. Olds and Wanza
were to take turns sleeping in the kitchen, and I
soldered an old canteen to be used as a hot-water
bottle at the big man’s feet. And I did sundry
small errands that Mrs. Olds required of me before
I was dismissed for the night. But when
Joey and I closed the kitchen door behind us and
stole away in the darkness beneath the yews to
our new sleeping quarters in the workshop, I
went with an effulgent glow and rapture at my
heart. She was beneath my roof. She was eating my bread.
The room on which I had labored
through many an arduous day out of love and
compassion for Joey had become a haven of refuge
for my wonder woman.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>THE KICKSHAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE doctor came early the next morning
and he rendered me incredibly favorable
reports of both his patients; so that I was
able to buoy myself up with the hope of seeing
Haidee before many days had passed. She sent
me a series of charming messages by Wanza
throughout the day. The first message was to
the effect that the room was delicious and the bed
like down. Again—the air through the open
windows and door was sweet as the breath of
asphodel. And the last message said that the
outlook through the windows was so sylvan that
almost she expected to hear the pipes of Pan, or
see a faun perched upon the rocks, or a Psyche at
the pool.</p>

<p>I hugged these gracious words to my heart, and
began work at once on a reclining-chair in which
Haidee could rest during her convalescence, and
the fashioning of two little crutches of cedar, the
doctor having confided to me that when Haidee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
left her bed she would require the support of
crutches for a week or two.</p>

<p>The second day, the message from the cedar
room thrilled me: “Tell Mr. Dale that I have
been lifted high on my pillows where I can watch
Joey at work in the Dingle.” Later on the question
came: “Joey is making something. What
is it?”</p>

<p>Joey was passing through the kitchen when I
received this message. I called to him: “What
are you doing in the Dingle, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Pooh,” he said, puffing out his cheeks, “I’m
not doing anything!”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all, Joey?”</p>

<p>“I’m just covering a cedar round for a—a
hassock for her—Bell Brandon’s feet when she
sits up. I’m covering it with the skin of that
mink you trapped last fall.”</p>

<p>I duly reported this to Wanza. She looked
at me, tossed her head, and went quickly back to
the cedar room. I began to think Mrs. Olds’
pessimism was infecting her. Certainly my
bright, insouciant Wanza seemed changed to me
since her installation at Haidee’s bedside.</p>

<p>I received messages too, from the sick man,
but disjointed, vague outbursts that showed his
mind was still wandering in the realms of fantasy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>“Tell my host,” he begged Mrs. Olds, “that
I’m a sick man—a very sick man. Tell him I
say I’m a gentleman—a perfect gentleman.
Tell him he’s a gentleman, too. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>—and
all that sort of thing, you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Olds gathered that he was a mining man
from Alaska, with interests in the Cœur d’Alenes,
and that his name was Bailey. She had discovered
a leather wallet in his coat pocket with the
name in gold letters on the flap, and his linen was
marked with a B. Pending absolute certainty
that his name was Bailey, we all, with the exception
of Mrs. Olds, continued to designate him
“the big man”; and as days went on, Joey added
to this and called him the big bad man, for his
language waxed coarser. He was almost violent
at times, and I was glad that the tiny corridor
separated Haidee’s room from the one in which
he lay.</p>

<p>The doctor diagnosed his case as typhoid, and
promised us a speedy convalescence. He looked
at me significantly and added: “He’ll recover.
But when he goes to that unknown bourne,
finally, he may not depart by a route as respectable
by far. He’s a periodical drinker—about
all in. Can’t stand much more.”</p>

<p>A few days after this I received an unexpected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
order for a cedar chest from a writer who signed
herself Janet Jones, and directed that the chest
when completed, should be sent to Spokane.</p>

<p>“I have seen your cedar chests,” she wrote.
“And how I want one! I am a shut in—and I
want the beauty chest in my boudoir, because it
will remind me of the cool, green cedars in the
depth of the forest, of wood aisles purpling at
twilight, of ferns and grass and all the plushy,
dear, delightful things that bend and blow and
flaunt themselves in the summer breeze. When
I look at it, I am sure I can hear again the voice
of the tortuous, swift-running, shadowy river on
whose banks it was made. And I long to hear
that sound again.”</p>

<p>The check she enclosed was a generous one.
The letter seemed almost a sacred thing to me.
I folded it carefully and laid it away, and not
even to Joey did I mention the order I had received.
But I began work at once on the cedar
chest. And I labored faithfully, and with infinite
relish. The check was a material help to
me, and something prompted me to lay bare my
heart and tell my new friend so in the note of
thanks I penned her that night.</p>

<p>“The wood paths are overrun with kinnikinic,
lupine, and Oregon grape just now,” I wrote,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
“and the woods are in their greenest livery. The
paint brushes are just coming into bloom and the
white flowers on the salmon berry bushes were
never so large before, or the coral honeysuckle so
fragrant. My senses tell me this is so; but there
is a deeper green in the heart of the woods, a
tenderer purple on the mountains, because of one
who bides temporarily beneath my roof. And
because of her—oh, kind benefactress, I thank
you for your order, for your praise, and for your
check! I am poor—miserably poor. And for
the first time in eight years ashamed of it.”</p>

<p>The answer came back in a few days:</p>

<p>“Don’t be ashamed! Tell me of her, please.”</p>

<p>Because the hour of Haidee’s convalescence
when I could greet her face to face, was postponed
from day to day, and because my thoughts
were full of her, I was glad to answer this letter.
But after all I told Janet Jones very little of
Haidee, except that she was my guest, and that
Joey and I called her our Wonder Woman, and
that my own name for her was Haidee.</p>

<p>Each day that followed was well rounded out
with work. The workshop proved to be a veritable
house of refuge to Joey and me, whither
we fled to escape Mrs. Olds’ whining voice and
bickering, and the big man’s unsavory language.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
Here with windows wide to the breeze that swept
cool and clean from the mountains we labored
side by side, forgetting the discord within the
cabin, realizing only that it is good to live, to
labor and to love.</p>

<p>In addition to my work on the cedar chest I
was carving a design of spirea on a small oak
box, which when completed was to hold Joey’s
few but highly prized kickshaws. As the design
approached completion I observed the small boy
eyeing it almost with dissatisfaction from time to
time.</p>

<p>I was unused to this attitude in Joey, and one
day I asked, “Don’t you like it, lad?”</p>

<p>A spray of the graceful spirea lay on my work
bench. He picked it up, caressed it gently, and
laid it aside.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. David,” he said, “I do think spirea,
the pink kind, is the cunningest bush that grows!”</p>

<p>“I had reference to the box, Joey.”</p>

<p>His eyes met mine honestly. A flush crept up
to his brow through the tan.</p>

<p>“I almost say Gracious Lord! every time I
look at it, and you asked me not to say that any
more, Mr. David. It must be ’most as beautiful
as that fairy box you told me about one
day, that the girl carried in her arms when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
boatman poled her across that black river. I do
think you’re most too good to me.”</p>

<p>I knew then that my boy liked the box beyond
cavil.</p>

<p>But I reached the heart of his feeling with
regard to the trifle the following day. As I bent
over my work he said tentatively:</p>

<p>“I think we ought to do something for Wanza.
She’s doing a lot for us, isn’t she, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>I glanced up. Joey was sitting cross-legged
on my work bench, engaged in putting burrs together
in the shape of a basket.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “Wanza is very kind.”</p>

<p>“Then if you don’t mind, Mr. David—really
truly don’t mind—I’d like to give the kickshaw
box to her.”</p>

<p>The brown eyes that came up to mine were imploring,
the small tanned face was suddenly
aquiver with emotion. I laid my tools aside, and
looked thoughtfully out of the window.</p>

<p>“Wanza’s awfully good to me, Mr. David,”
the small boy continued. “She’s put patches on
my overalls, and sewed buttons on my shirts, and
darned my stockings—and the other day she
made me a kite. And she plays cat’s cradle with
me, and brings me glass marbles. And when she
gets rich she’s going to buy me a gold-fish.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“What a formidable list of good deeds. The
box is Wanza’s,” I declared, facing around.
“We will present it to her this evening.”</p>

<p>“Do you ’spose she has any kickshaws to put
in it, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“Why—I don’t know, lad, I don’t know,” I
replied musingly. “It seems to me very
probable.”</p>

<p>“Do girls have kickshaws, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“Almost every one has some sort of keepsake,
Joey lad.”</p>

<p>He surveyed his burr basket with disfavor, tore
it apart and began hurriedly to build it over.</p>

<p>“Say the kickshaw verse for me, Mr. David,
please, and after that the ‘Nine Little Goblins,’
and after that a little bit of ‘Tentoleena.’”</p>

<p>It was very pleasant there in the shop. The
perfume of summer was about us, and bird-song
and bee-humming and the mellow sound of the
brook blended into a delicate wood symphony. I
looked out upon the swift-running, sparkling,
clear river. To dip boyishly in it was my sudden
desire. The leafy green of the banks was likewise
inviting. Across the river the grey-blue
meadows stretched away to meet the purple foot
hills. I hung halfway out of the window and
recited the tuneful little rhyme for Joey:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Oh, the tiny little kickshaw that Mither sent tae me,</div>
<div class="verse">’Tis sweeter than the sugar-plum that reepens on the tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Wi’ denty flavorin’s o’ spice an’ musky rosemarie,</div>
<div class="verse">The tiny little kickshaw that Mither sent tae me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Oh I love the tiny kickshaw, and I smack my lips wi’ glee,</div>
<div class="verse">Aye mickle do I love the taste o’ sic a luxourie,</div>
<div class="verse">But maist I love the lovin’ hands that could the giftie gie</div>
<div class="verse">O’ the tiny little kickshaw that Mither sent tae me.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Joey was a rare listener, his face had a sparkle
in concentration seldom seen. It was an inspiration
to the retailer. Wherever this is found, to
my notion, it gives to a face an unusual distinction
and charm. As I finished he drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>“Mothers gives kickshaws to their girls and
boys ’most always, I ’spose,” he murmured questioningly.
His eyes were wistful, and hurt me
in a strange way.</p>

<p>“Almost always, I think, Joey.”</p>

<p>I smiled at him, and he smiled back bravely.</p>

<p>“I’m your boy—almost really and truly your
boy—ain’t I, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“Pooh,” he said with a swagger, “I’d liever be
your boy than—than anything! You give me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
kickshaws and make me magpie cages, and—and
flutes and bow-guns, and you builded me a
bed—”</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly, and without seeming to
look at him I saw that his eyes were tear filled,
and that he was winking fast and furiously to
keep the drops from falling.</p>

<p>“Now then,” I said, speaking somewhat
huskily, “I shall give you ‘Nine Little Goblins.’”
Clearing my throat I began:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“They all climbed up on a high board fence,</div>
<div class="verse">Nine little goblins with green-glass eyes—</div>
<div class="verse">Nine little goblins who had no sense</div>
<div class="verse">And couldn’t tell coppers from cold mince pies.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I finished the poem and went on to “Tentoleena,” saying:</p>

<p>“I think Mr. Riley has intended this a bit more
for girls than for boys, however, we love its tinkle,
don’t we, Joey?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Up in Tentoleena Land—</div>
<div class="indent2">Tentoleena! Tentoleena!</div>
<div class="verse">All the dollies, hand in hand,</div>
<div class="indent2">Mina, Nainie, and Serena,</div>
<div class="verse">Dance the Fairy fancy dances,</div>
<div class="verse">With glad songs and starry glances.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“If I was a girl—and had a doll—I’d never let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
her get up alone at Moon-dawn and go out and
wash her face in those great big dew-drops with
cream on ’em. Why—she might get drownded!
I wouldn’t call her Christine Braibry, anyway—”
Joey delivered himself of this ultimatum quite in
his usual manner. And feeling somewhat relieved I inquired:</p>

<p>“What name would you choose, boy—Wanza
or—”</p>

<p>“Not Wanza—no girl’s name! I wouldn’t
have a girl-doll! I’d fix it up in pants and call
it Mr. David.”</p>

<p>After supper that evening I asked Wanza to
come to the workshop with Joey and me. She
gave me a laughing glance as I held open the
kitchen door for her, and stood teetering in indecision
at the sink with Joey clinging to her
skirt.</p>

<p>“There are the dishes to be washed, and Mrs.
Batterly’s tea to be carried to her, and the milk
pans to scald, and—”</p>

<p>“Wanza,” Joey cried, “you must come! It’s
a surprise.”</p>

<p>She danced across the room, tossed her apron
on to a chair, and rolled down her sleeves. Her
eyes glowed suddenly black with excitement, her
red lips quirked at the corners. She tossed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
head, and all her snarled mop of hair writhed and
undulated about her spirited face. She sprang
outside with the lightness of a kitten followed by
Joey, and I closed the door carefully at Mrs.
Olds’ instigation, and followed her to the yew
path.</p>

<p>The heavy-blossomed service bushes hedged the
path like a flowered wall, silver shadows lay
around us, but through the fretwork of tree branches
we saw a mauve twilight settling down
over the valley. The river was a twisting purple
cord. In the violet sky a half-lit crescent moon
was swimming like a fairy canoe afloat on a
mythical sea. All objects were soft to the sight—thin
and shadowy. The spike-like leaves
above our heads glistened ghostily, the trunks of
trees bulked like curling ominous shapes in the
vista before us. Puffs of wind caused the maples
to make faint, pattering under-breaths of sound.</p>

<p>We stood on the miniature bridge for a
moment. The reeds were shooting up in the bed
of the spring; and as we stood on the bridge they
were almost waist high about us. A tule wren
flew from among them, perched on a nearby cottonwood,
and gave a series of short wild notes
for our edification. It flirted about on its perch,
with many a bob and twitch as we watched it, apparently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
scolding at us for daring to approach
so close to its habitat.</p>

<p>And we stood there in the musical, colorful
twilight, my thoughts flew to Haidee, and I asked
Wanza how she was faring.</p>

<p>“Well enough,” she retorted, with a swift back
flinging of her blonde head.</p>

<p>“Well enough means very well, does it,
Wanza?”</p>

<p>“If you can’t make me out, Mr. Dale, I guess
I better quit talking. Seems like you never used
to have no trouble.”</p>

<p>“I believe I am growing obtuse,” I replied
lightly. And led the way across the bridge to the
shop without further ado.</p>

<p>Had I dreamed that Wanza would have been
so affected by the simple gift I tendered, I doubt
if I would have had sufficient temerity to present
it to her. I did this with a flourish, saying:</p>

<p>“You have been so kind to Joey and me,
Wanza, that we beg you to accept this little kickshaw
case in token of our appreciation. Joey
hunted out the finest specimens of spirea for me,
and I carved the lid, as you see, and cut your
initials here in the corner.”</p>

<p>Ah, the light in the brilliant deep blue eyes
raised to mine! the smile on the tender lips, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
sobbing breath with which she spoke. I was
stirred and vaguely abashed.</p>

<p>“You did this for me—for me,” she repeated,
laughing, and shaking her head, and all but weeping.
She clasped the box close to her girlish
breast with a huddling movement of her arms,
sank her chin upon it, caressed the smooth wood
with her cheek. “It’s beautiful, beautiful! Oh,
thank you, Mr. Dale, thank you!” Joey was
cuddling against her shoulder and she put her
arm out after a moment, took him into her embrace
and kissed him with a soft lingering pressure
of her lips against his.</p>

<p>When she stood upright at length her face was
wreathed in smiles, and though I spied a tear on
her lashes, it was with a ringing laugh that she
said:</p>

<p>“I know what a box is, and I guess I know a
case when I see it, but you’ll have to tell me what
a kickshaw is, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>I laughed heartily. And then Joey would
have me recite Riley’s delicious little rhyme.
The evening ended pleasantly for us all. But it
left me with food for musing. Yes, I said to myself,
Wanza was kind—she had ever been kind
to Joey and me. Had I been too cavalier in my
treatment of her? Remembering her sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
softening, her appreciation of my small gift, I
decided this was so. In future, I assured myself,
I would show her every consideration. Wanza
was growing up. She was no child to be
hectored, and bantered, cajoled and then neglected.
No! My treatment of her must be uniformly
courteous hereafter.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>IN SHOP AND DINGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT seemed to me during the next few days
that Wanza bloomed magically; as she
worked she chirruped, her feet were light, a
bird seemed to sing in her breast. I knew not
to what to attribute the change. She was still
the debonair girl, but she was wholly woman; and
she was vital as a spirit, beautiful as a flower.
We grew vastly companionable.</p>

<p>We walked together along the flowery riverways
in the twilight; at night we watched the
ribbons of clouds tangle into pearly folds across
the moon’s face, and the stars grow bright in the
purple urn of heaven. Mornings we climbed the
heights and gathered wild strawberries for
Haidee’s luncheon, and often in the late afternoon
Wanza would come to the shop and I would
help her with her studies.</p>

<p>It was pleasant, too, to take the glasses, and
penetrate deep into the heart of the greenwood
and sit immovable among the shrubbery, bird-spying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
as Joey called it. It was Wanza’s delight
to see me stand perfectly still in a certain
spot near the shop, where a bed of fragrant old-fashioned
pinks frequently absorbed my attention,
and wait for the sparrows and nuthatches
that often came to alight on my head. Inside
my shop I was tending a young cedar waxwing
that had dropped at my feet from a cherry tree
near the cabin one morning. Joey had given the
bird assiduous attention, and was overjoyed when
a few days later he found it friendly enough to
sit on his hand. We named the bird, Silly Cedar.
And I made him a roomy cage of slender cedar
sticks. He seldom inhabited the cage, however,
choosing rather to flutter freely about the workshop.</p>

<p>Wanza’s joy in the birds was a pleasure to
witness. I was at my work bench one morning,
when chancing to glance through the open
window I saw a charming picture. The girl
stood by the bed of clove pinks, a veritable pink
and white Dresden shepherdess in one of the
stiffest, most immaculate of her cotton frocks, her
hair an unbound, pale-flaming banner about her
shoulders. On her head was poised a nuthatch.</p>

<p>It was the expression of her face that captivated
me,—smiling, rapt, almost prayerful, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
invoking the spirit of all aerial things. Both
arms were out as though she were balancing the
dainty object that perched so delicately upon her
head. In every fibre she appeared electrified, as
though about to soar with the birds. Again I
had that sensation of glimpsing beneath the girl’s
casual self and finding a transfigured being.</p>

<p>The bird fluttered away as I gazed, Wanza
stooped, gathering the flowers, and I went out
to her.</p>

<p>She flirted the pinks beneath her chin as she
looked up at me.</p>

<p>“I’ve been up since five,” she laughed. Even
her laugh was subdued.</p>

<p>“And what have you been doing since five?”
I asked idly.</p>

<p>She opened a box that lay on the grass at her
side.</p>

<p>“I’ve been up on Nigger Head after these. I
saw them yesterday when I went to old Lundquist’s
to take him a bit of cottage cheese I’d
made. See!”</p>

<p>I looked as she bade me. Within the box were
some fine specimens of ferns and swamp laurel,
and a rare white blossom that I had never seen
in western woods. An airy, dainty, frosty-white,
tiny star-flower.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“They are for you. I heard you wishing for
swamp laurel.”</p>

<p>“You are very, very kind, Wanza,” I replied.</p>

<p>I lifted the laurel, but my eyes were on the
white flower, and my heart was overcharged,
and as I looked a blur crossed my vision and I
could not see the waxen petals. But I saw another
woods, lush and sweet, hard by a southern
homestead, I heard the darkies singing in the
fields adjoining, and the sound of the river running
between red clay banks. I saw my mother’s
smile.</p>

<p>I felt weak at that moment. I needed to grip
hard a friendly hand. “Nothing, not God, is
greater to one than one’s self is, and whoever
walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his
own funeral drest in his shroud.” Walt Whitman
spoke truly. Someway I knew that
Wanza’s sympathy was true and exquisite, that
her understanding was profound. I had never
before thought of this, but suddenly I knew that
it was so. She tendered me the little white
flower on her open palm, and I reached out and
took it and I took her hand, saying:</p>

<p>“You are a good girl, Wanza Lyttle.”</p>

<p>My tongue was ineffectual to say what I would
have said, and so I said nothing. The white of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
her face crimsoned as I held her hand. Her blue
eyes said a thousand things I could not sense.
But her lips merely murmured, “What is the
swamp laurel for, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“I want to make a design of laurel for a tray I
intend to carve. You see, Wanza, I am beginning
already to think of the holiday trade. At
Christmas I shall send some of my work to the
city to an art store there.”</p>

<p>We passed on to the workshop, and presently
Joey joined us there.</p>

<p>“It seems to me, Mr. David,” he said as he
entered, “that to-day is yesterday.”</p>

<p>I smiled at him appreciatively. I had come to
call Joey my philosopher in knee breeches. He
resumed, puffing out his cheeks in his characteristic
way, “’Cause I been so busy. I guess if a
body was busy enough there wouldn’t be no
time.”</p>

<p>“We make our own limitations, Joey,” I said,
bending over my cedar chest that was all but
finished. “The Now is the principal thing, boy.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Olds is the queerest lady,” he went on,
“always watching the clock. An’ she don’t like
our ways, Mr. David—she said so! She says
we’re slip-shod. Hit and miss, she says, that’s
the way we live. My, she’s funny! At night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
she says, ‘Well, I’m glad this day is over,’ an’ in
the morning she says, ‘Dear me! I thought it
would never come morning! I’m glad the night
is gone.’ I said to her—I said to her—” Joey
paused, having used up his breath, and requiring
a fresh supply.</p>

<p>“Go slowly,” I advised. “What did you say,
Joey? Get a good breath and tell Wanza and
me.”</p>

<p>“I said: ‘How can you hate both times? It
keeps you busy hating, don’t it?’ An’ if you’re
busy hating, Mr. David, what time do you get to
feed the birds, an’ watch the squirrels, an’ make
burr baskets and cedar chests, an’ bow-guns and
flutes?”</p>

<p>Joey put his head on one side and looked up
at me inquiringly out of his bright shrewd eyes.</p>

<p>“Not much time, I’m afraid, Joey,” I responded,
knowing that he expected a reply.</p>

<p>“Of course not. Come here, Silly Cedar,” he
called softly to the Waxwing. He gave a
musical whistling note, and the bird, that was
perched on the work bench, flew to him and
alighted on his outstretched hand. He made a
picture that I was to remember in other sadder
days, standing thus, holding the bird, scarce moving,
so great was his ecstasy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Very soon after this the chair reached completion.
Upholstered in burlap and stuffed with
moss, it stood in the small rustic pergola outside
the cedar room, awaiting Haidee. Joey’s hassock
rested beside it. And at last one day after
I had worked myself into a state of fine frenzy
at the delay I was told that she was sitting in
state in the new chair awaiting me. I hurried to
the Dingle, parted the underbrush, and stood
gazing at my wonder woman before she was
aware of my coming.</p>

<p>She sat leaning back in the big chair. She
looked very weary and pale as she reclined there.
The rough silk of her robe was blue—the rare
blue sometimes seen in paintings of old Madonnas.
Her lovely throat was bare. Her
creamy hands with their pink-tinted nails lay idly
clasped in her lap; and her feet, resting on Joey’s
hassock, were shod in strange Oriental flat-heeled
slippers with big drunken-looking rosettes on the
toes.</p>

<p>“You are quite recovered?” I asked, stepping
forward.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dale!” she cried, and seemed unable
to proceed. And I found myself bending above
her with both of her hands in mine, looking down
into her shadowy, mysterious eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>I summoned my voice at last, and spoke rather
indistinctly: “Joey and I have been awaiting
your convalescence impatiently. Joey has been
very anxious about his Bell Brandon, as he calls
you.”</p>

<p>She still sat with her hands in mine, and she
looked up at me with a strangely quiet gaze and
replied gravely: “I like Joey’s name for me.
Does he really call me that?”</p>

<p>“Why,” I said, “I have even ventured to call
you so in mentioning you to Joey.”</p>

<p>I released her hands and seated myself on the
steps below her. There was a silence. The sun
slipped behind a cloud. The shadows in the
Dingle deepened to invisible green velvet. In
the perfume and hush I could hear my heart beat.
It was very still. A cat-bird called from the
thicket, the hum of bees buzzing among the
clover in the meadow came to us with a sabbath
sound.</p>

<p>Haidee looked at me and smiled. “It is very
restful here. How is your other patient progressing?”</p>

<p>“Very well, I believe.”</p>

<p>“This is a splendid sanatorium. I had some
wonderful dreams in that cedar room.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear about them. I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
curious to know what dreams the room induced,”
I answered, with rather too much impressment,
I’m afraid.</p>

<p>She leaned her head against the burlapped
chair back and lowered her lashes against her
cheek. I studied her face. During her illness
she seemed to have undergone a subtle transformation.
There were lines about her drooping
eyes, something cold and almost austere in the
expression of her face that I had not noticed before.
She seemed farther from me than she had
yet seemed—immeasurably remote.</p>

<p>“The dreams were very good dreams—restful
dreams.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said gently.</p>

<p>“They were dreams of homey things—simple,
plain things—and yet there was a zest in them—a
repose—a complete forgetfulness.”</p>

<p>“Forgetfulness?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Isn’t forgetfulness the Nirvana of the
Hindu? If we remember we may regret. If we
have no thought backward or forward, we are
blissfully quiescent.”</p>

<p>I watched a yellow warbler preening itself on
a swinging bough of a tamarack. “It is easier
to have no thought forward—perhaps,” I said
slowly after a pause.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>“You think so, too? I am sure of it. The
past is an insistent thing—a ghoulish thing—waving
shrouded arms over the present. To forget!—ah,
there’s the rub.”</p>

<p>She spoke precipitately, turning her head restlessly
this way and that on the rough cushion.
The line of her throat, the tiny fluffy ringlets at
the roots of her hair, the curve of her lovely cheek,
stirred my blood strangely.</p>

<p>“Tell me something more of yourself,” I
blurted out abruptly.</p>

<p>She started. Her eyes grew bleak, worn with
memories, it seemed; her face that had shone
warmly pale, changed and stiffened to marble.
She answered in a cold, slight voice: “There is
so little to tell.” After awhile she added:
“Perhaps some day you will tell me your story.”</p>

<p>I sat and watched the yellow warbler, reflecting
on the strange relief it would be to recite to
sympathetic ears my pent-up dreary tale, my
baleful tale of a scourging past, of present loneliness
and hard plain living. It was the sort of
tale that is never told—unless the teller be a
driveller. I laughed cheerlessly, and someway
the brightness of the hour was clouded by the
phantom of the past that Haidee’s words had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
invoked. And the phantom dared to stand even
at the gate of the future and demand toll, so that
neither past, present nor future was a thing to
rejoice in.</p>

<p>My face must have grown grim. I clenched
and unclenched my hand on my knee. Haidee’s
voice continued: “But in the meantime you
don’t know me—the real every day me—and I
don’t know you—the real you; and it’s interesting,
rather, to speak to each other, like sliding
wraith-like ships that pass to opposite ports.
We fling our voices out—then darkness again—and
a silence.”</p>

<p>“I am what I am,” I answered quickly.</p>

<p>She nodded concurrence. “Dear me! Of
course. But you were not always what you are
now. That’s the point. And, some day, I shall
persuade you to tell me all.”</p>

<p>I answered pointedly: “In the words of
Olivia, ‘you might do much.’”</p>

<p>She laughed oddly, almost amusedly, at my
vehemence, and swayed back a little from me as
I held out my hand. “Good-bye,” I said, “for
to-day.” And when she yielded me her hand I
pressed it lightly and let it go.</p>

<p>I had never tried, until that moment, to analyze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the quality of my sentiment for Haidee. I had
been filled with a vague romantic idealism where
my wonder woman was concerned, but suddenly
I was restless, and dissatisfied with idealising. I
wanted to know Judith Batterly—the real
woman. I wanted to pierce the veil of mysticism
in which she was wrapped. I was not content
with the artificiality of our discourse. It seemed
to me I failed to strike a note truly sound in any
of our talks. The real woman eluded me. I
could not bring Haidee down to my plane from
the dream-world where only she seemed to
function. She was ever remote. And I wanted
to understand fully my feeling for her.</p>

<p>When I fell asleep that night, dreams of
Haidee and Wanza were commingled. Once I
awoke, dressed completely, and walked outside
the workshop in the clear, balmy air of the night.
I lay down on the river bank and watched a particularly
big bright star that hung just over the
crest of Nigger Head. I thought of Wanza—of
her new and gentler ways that were replacing
the old crisp brightness of demeanor—and I
smiled. I thought of Haidee—and I sighed.
Then my thoughts flew to the kickshaw case I
had given Wanza and her reception of it, and to
the swamp laurel she had risen at daybreak to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
gather for me, and thinking of these things I
went back to the workshop and crept in beside
Joey, and with my arm about the lad slept dreamlessly
till morning.</p>

<small>DEFICIENCIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT this time I wrote in my diary:
“A man in love is an oaf. How
awkward and lumbering he is in the
presence of his Dulcinea. How undesirable and
like a clod away from her. He is a churl to
every one but the one woman. I have been out
in the sun-splashed forest searching for rare
specimens of the wood anemone for my wonder
woman. My search absorbed my morning, and
I quite forgot that I had promised Wanza to
ride to town for flour for the weekly baking. I
dreamed and mused the hours away among the
basaltic boulders in a strange grove of twisted
yews, where nereid green pools lie in little hollows
and maiden hair springs up through the gold-brown
moss carpet. This grove has long been
a favorite of mine. It has a classical aspect;
there is something about it that suggests a train
of mythological conceptions. I feel sure that the
great God Pan must be fashioning his flute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
among the rushes in the bed of the spring. In
the wind’s sibilance I hear the skirl of the Pandean
pipes. I recall the divine huntress, and
summon up visions of Iris, the goddess of many
colors.”</p>

<p>This morning the wood spaces were filled with
visions of Haidee. She smiled at me from behind
the clumps of bracken and huckleberry, her
eyes beamed at me from the hearts of the flowers.
The clouds were her garments, the blue
sky her soul. As Dante walked dreaming of
Beatrice so went I with Haidee ever before me.</p>

<p>Love is a rejuvenating precious thing. Even
a hopeless love softens the fibres of one’s entire
being, and straightens the warped soul of one.
But I must not reach out toward Love! I must
renounce. I must go on alone, like a battered,
wrecked, drifting derelict. I have thought the
blackest part of my life behind me. I have come
to look forward too much. I have vented my
heavy heart, and found solace in work and books.
And now! I must live through the culminating
sorrow. Is all my life to be one great renunciation?
I find myself rebelling. I have been too
much the helpless victim of circumstances. For
me Ossa has been heaped on Pelion.</p>

<p>I have said, “If I can but avoid comparing my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
lot with what it might have been, I can be a man.”
I have repeated: “I swear the earth shall surely
be complete to him or her who shall be complete.
The earth remains jagged and broken only to
him or her who remains jagged and broken.” I
have said all this to myself times innumerable.
And now what shall I say to myself? I can
scarcely whisper to myself, “Courage!” I am
baffled, balked, stunned. Oh, what do I signify
in the scheme of things! I am a bit of washed
spindrift. Glad should I be to surrender the
quick of being. If it were not for work!— Through
labor only I come near to God, the
master artizan, who labors tirelessly and marvelously.</p>

<p>After making this entry in my diary I gained
an unexpected surcease from wearied thoughts.
I went on with my life calmly enough, doing the
things nearest to hand, eating three good meals
a day as a man will, writing on my novel evenings,
and sleeping normally, with Joey curled into a
warm little ball at my side. In some strange way
after my descent into Avernus I became tranquil
in every pulse. After brooding over much I sat
back, figuratively speaking, and thought of
nothing, but the simple joy of being. Sunlight
was pure gold, the dew silver, each twilight a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
benediction, each dawn a natal hymn. I managed
so that I saw very little of Haidee, paying
my respects to her once a day, and pleading work
as an excuse if invited to linger in the shady
Dingle where she sat with her work or a book. I
contemplated sending Joey to school in the
autumn, and a portion of each day I devoted to
teaching the small lad spelling. His remarks
concerning the rite were often pungent. He
persevered to please me, but I could see that in
his heart he pitied me for my zealous attempts on
his behalf.</p>

<p>“When people can say things what’s the use
of spelling?” he asked one day. He held his
book upside down, his eyes fixed longingly on a
skimming prismatic cloud of butterflies beyond
the workshop door. “I can say God—what’s the
good of spelling it?” I did not respond, and
evidently anxious to convince me further, he
added: “Yes. And one time once—oh, when I
was teenty, Mr. David, I thought I saw him.”</p>

<p>“Do you think now that you saw him, Joey?”
I questioned, half smiling.</p>

<p>“Well,” he replied slowly, as if pondering the
matter, “I was sure then, Mr. David.”</p>

<p>“Where did you see the—er—person whom
you believed to be God?” I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>“In the village.”</p>

<p>“Did he speak to you, Joey?”</p>

<p>Joey looked at me slyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. David,” he whispered deprecatingly,
“do you ’spose I’d ’spect him to—when I’m a
worm?”</p>

<p>I went on with the lesson, vaguely wondering
what sort of mind the lady who taught Joey at
Sunday School was possessed of.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the lesson, Joey observed:
“Mrs. Olds says our cabin is full of de—deficiencies,
Mr. David. What do de—deficiencies
do?”</p>

<p>“Deficiencies let flies in, and permit mice to
molest the flour barrel,—deficiencies make chimneys
smoke, and floors creak.”</p>

<p>“Hm! Are de—deficiencies holes, Mr.
David?”</p>

<p>“In a sense, lad.”</p>

<p>“Where’d be the fun, though,” my loyal lad
cried out, “if there weren’t no holes in cabins.
There’d be nothing to patch. An’ you’d never
see a rat poke his cunning head through the wall
cold nights when you sit by the fire. Pooh! I
like de—deficiencies.”</p>

<p>That very day I went about setting what traps
I had to catch the rodents that were destroying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Mrs. Olds’ peace of mind. And I began the
manufacture of others. I also mended the screen
doors, and purchased a package of mosquito
netting from Wanza’s cart, for the windows.</p>

<p>It was a curious ménage I captained. I found
myself grinning from time to time as I took
orders from Mrs. Olds. Although I was in love
with Haidee, and although Joey was an entertaining
companion, and although I found Mrs.
Olds’ pessimism a curious study, it was to Wanza
that I turned most frequently for comfort and
advice during these trying days. We had many
a rueful laugh together at Mrs. Olds’ expense.</p>

<p>“The whole thing with her, I do think,” Wanza
said, one day, “is drawing her pay.”</p>

<p>But Wanza maligned her. Mrs. Olds was a
rare nurse, conscientious to a fault. And she received
little enough pay from the big man, I
knew. Wanza had a cot in the cedar room now,
and Mrs. Olds was able to rest the greater part
of the night, as her patient’s condition improved.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />


<small>JACK OF ALL TRADES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN due time I received another communication
from my unknown friend. Very brief
it was. It said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I appreciate your confidence. I am glad to know
of Haidee. But I want still more to know of yourself.
Can you trust me?”</p>
</div>

<p>I did not answer this at once, revolving it in
my mind. A few days later I wrote in this wise:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is little to know, kind friend. Eight years
ago, when I was twenty-four, I came to Idaho. I took
up a homestead on the Cœur d’Alene River. I proved
up on it, and I have sold all but sixteen acres. I have
worked hard. I have grown horny-handed, weather-beaten
and a bit gray. I live in a flannel shirt and
corduroy trousers, and I eat off a pine table in the
kitchen of a three-roomed shack. Lately, I have developed
into a craftsman. It is a sordid enough tale—is
it not?”</p>
</div>

<p>Conversations with Haidee were still infrequent.
Wanza ordinarily shared them, and Joey
was nearly always present.</p>

<p>We were seated in a group about the pool in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the Dingle, one morning, Haidee in her chair,
Joey at her feet with Jingles asleep at his side,
Wanza on the brink of the pool with her tatting,
gazing in from time to time at the reflection of
her pale blonde loveliness, while I, seated on a
stump of a pine tree, was carving a bow-gun for
Joey.</p>

<p>There was a white syringa bush above Haidee
that was dropping pale flowers on her head.
They seemed to me like perfumed petals of Paradise.
I caught one as it fell, smiling into her
tranquil eyes. I said to myself that with each
succeeding day Haidee’s voice grew lighter, her
laughter more frequent, her expression brighter.</p>

<p>As we sat there, an entrancing harmony arose
about us. Waves of ecstatic melody swelled and
softened and swelled again through the green
fragrant woods. Trills on one hand, deep
throaty mellow carolings on the other. The
thrush, the warbler, the sparrow joined in a
mighty chorus.</p>

<p>“What a magnificent orchestra,” Haidee cried.
“The birds are holding high carnival.”</p>

<p>The pearl-like, throbbing symphony grew
sweeter and sweeter. We sat spellbound drinking
in the enchantment with hungry ears. Suddenly
I cried:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>“Look! There is a lazuli-bunting.”</p>

<p>I pointed to the feathered blue beauty that was
winging its way to a nearby maple.</p>

<p>“Lazuli-bunting?” Haidee echoed. “What a
cosy name. I suppose the baby birds are called
baby buntings, Joey.”</p>

<p>Joey looked up in her face with adoration in
his brown eyes, and she moved a little forward
and pressed his head gently back against her
knee. They contemplated each other with a sort
of radiant satisfaction.</p>

<p>“No one ever told me about baby buntings,”
Joey declared at last.</p>

<p>“What a shame! Mr. Dale, do you know you
have neglected Joey’s education?”</p>

<p>Very slowly and prettily Haidee repeated the
old rhyme, her fingers stroking the lad’s sunburnt
cheek. Wanza’s eyes were very big and
strangely burning as they rested on her. And
her lips were drawn into a straight, unlovely red
line as she finally dropped her regard to her tatting.
I carved in silence, and the lazuli-bunting
was forgotten as the recital of the nursery
rhyme led to the demand for others.</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I teased, going up behind her in the
kitchen later, and reaching round to tickle her
chin with a ribbon grass as she bent over the ironing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
board. “Wanza, why so pensive? Where
are your smiles?”</p>

<p>“She smiles enough for both,” Wanza retorted,
giving an angry flirt to the ruffle she was ironing.
“I don’t know which is the worst—your
smiley kind or your everlasting scolds. Mrs.
Olds would sour the cream—and Mrs. Batterly’s
eternal smirk makes me think of a sick calf.
And when I feel like rushing around and biting
the furniture it’s just enough to kill me, so it is,
to have her so purry and mealy-mouthed.”</p>

<p>“But why should you want to rush around and
bite the furniture?” I asked in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Oh, just because I’m a great big rough, mean-tempered
country girl! I’ve never had real
bringing up.” Tears stood in Wanza’s stormy
eyes. “No perfect lady ever felt like biting anything.
Oh, please go away, Mr. Dale, and leave
me be—I’m cross and tired—and not fit to be
noticed!”</p>

<p>I saw Mrs. Olds smiling palely at me from the
door of the sick room. She tiptoed forward.</p>

<p>“Hush,” she whispered. “My patient is
asleep. He is quite rational, Mr. Dale. In a
few days he will be able to sit up.”</p>

<p>With Mrs. Olds’ permission I went in and
stood at the bedside and looked down at the sleeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
man. He was thin and his face was lean and
white. He looked a very different being from
the man who had staggered into the cabin that
night in the storm. He looked more nearly a
man as God intended him to look. His brow was
high, his jaw clean cut, his hair grew luxuriantly
on his well-shaped head. But his mouth beneath
the brown moustache was loose-lipped, self indulgent,
and obstinate. And there was something
hateful to me in the set of his thick neck
on his big shoulders.</p>

<p>I returned to the kitchen. It was very hot in
the small room, and the steam that arose from a
kettle of soup on the stove as Wanza lifted the
lid assailed my nose and eyes unpleasantly. I
opened the door to allow the steam to escape, and
Wanza spoke hastily:</p>

<p>“Shut the door, Mr. Dale, please, you’re cooling
off the oven, and I’m baking this morning.”</p>

<p>“Does a whiff of air like that cool your oven?”
I asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Well, I should say so. My, it’s hot in here!”
I looked at her red face, and as I did so an
inspiration came to me. “Wanza,” I said, “why
should I not make you a fireless cooker?”</p>

<p>She stared at me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Is there any reason why you would not like
one?” I queried.</p>

<p>“Glory! I’d like one right enough.”</p>

<p>“Come to the workshop after dinner,” I rejoined,
“and we will discuss it.”</p>

<p>Wanza came to the shop later in the afternoon
and I convinced her that the construction of a
fireless cooker was a bagatelle to a skilled craftsman
such as I considered myself to be. Her face
flamed with the fire of her enthusiasm. She
caught my hand, and cried:</p>

<p>“You’re a fixing man, all right! You sure
are.”</p>

<p>I had never seen her blue eyes so softly grateful
before. They were like humid flowers. Her
voice was full and low. Her hand pressed my
hand, and clung. Seeing her thus moved I
stammered:</p>

<p>“Why, I seem to be a sort of Jack of all trades.
A Jack of all trades is master of none, usually.”
Her face was very close to mine, and what with
her strange witchery and her appealing wistfulness
I might have said more; but as I gazed at her
my senses untangled, and I locked my lips. I
shook my head at her, and I smiled a little deprecatingly
and loosed my hand as she murmured:
“I think you’re just grand—just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
grand! You’re kind as kind can be. Oh, Mr.
David Dale, you sure are a good, good fellow!”</p>

<p>“All of this because I am going to try to turn
out some sort of fireless cooker,” I remonstrated.</p>

<p>“You’re always trying to do something—for
somebody—trying to help along—that’s it. It
ain’t so much just this.”</p>

<p>Wanza was rather incoherent as she turned
and walked out of the shop. And someway instead
of her words of commendation heartening
me they left me dejected. But the cooker was a
success. A stout box, lined with asbestos, a receptacle
of tin, and sawdust for packing turned
the trick. And the corned-beef and cabbage that
Wanza, the conjurer, straightway evolved from
this crude contrivance left nothing to be desired.</p>

<p>The chicken Wanza cooked one day soon after
was so unusually succulent that we decided at
once to ride to the village before supper and carry
Captain Grif a generous portion.</p>

<p>“He’ll relish a bit of chicken after so much
pork and corn bread, and such living. I can
warm it up on the stove for him, and stir up some
biscuits, while you and him are having a game of
chess on the porch,” Wanza announced.</p>

<p>Accordingly we rode away over the ploughed
field together at about five o’clock, Mrs. Olds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
watching us dourly from the kitchen doorway,
and Joey yelling after us: “I’ll see to Bell
Brandon while you’re away.”</p>

<p>Captain Grif’s was the warmest of welcomes.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well,” he said, rising from his
rocker on the front porch as we mounted the
steps, “and here you be, the two of ye—and better
than a crowd, I say! By golly, s-ship-mate,
you’re a sight for sore eyes. You looked peaked,
too, and Wanza ain’t at her best. But sit right
down—Wanza, there’s the hammock—the hammock
I slept in many a night at sea—plump into
that now.”</p>

<p>He beamed at his daughter. It was good to
see his pride and delight in her.</p>

<p>“Dad,” Wanza said, wagging her bright head
at him, “something told us you was pining for
chicken—chicken with dumpling, Dad. It’s in
this pail. You sit here with Mr. Dale, and I’ll
get out the chessmen, and while you’re playing
I’ll warm up the stew. Then when you’ve had
your bite with us, I’ll play on the melodeon—I’ll
play ‘Bell Mahone’—and you and Mr. Dale can
sit on the porch and watch the moon come up, and
you can tell him stories; and pretty soon I’ll come
out, after I have tidied up, and go to sleep in the
hammock.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>It all fell out as Wanza planned. We had our
bite together; I helped carry the dishes to the
sink in the kitchen while Captain Grif filled his
pipe; and then Wanza played on the melodeon
and sang “Bell Mahone,” and “Wait for the
Wagon,” and “Bonnie Eloise,” while Captain
Grif and I chatted on the porch. The moon came
up later, and Wanza swung in the hammock and
dozed, or pretended to, while her father told me
one story after another. The central figure of
many of his tales was Dockery—the ship’s steward—whom
he described as a bald-pated, middle-aged
man, with a round face, a Mephistophelean
smile, and the helpless frown of a baby. “A curious
m-mixture that feller! I was some time readin’
him—but I read him. He wa’n’t very sharp—that
was his trouble mostly. It’s a trouble lots
of us is afflicted with. Them as knows it I have
a sort o’ respect for—them as don’t I ’bominate,
I sure do, s-ship-mate. Ignorance itself is bad
enough, but when it’s mixed proper with conceit,
they’s no standin’ it.” In this wise old Grif
would discourse much to our edification.</p>

<p>To-night he was hugely interested in dissecting
the big man’s character from bits concerning him
Wanza and I had dropped.</p>

<p>“I don’t take no stock in him, boy—I’ve told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Wanza so from the first—with all his nightshirts
embroidered like an old lady’s antimacassar!
And when he gets to settin’ up, and needs waitin’
on, I want Wanza should make herself scarce.
The gal tells me she thinks he is a rich man.
Well, may be—may be; that don’t mend matters
if he’s a rascal.”</p>

<p>At this juncture Wanza yawned, tossed her
arms abroad, and said sleepily:</p>

<p>“He’s a gentleman, Dad.”</p>

<p>Old Grif chuckled.</p>

<p>“Now, what do you mean by that? A gentleman!
Ump! I’ve never knowed the time I
ain’t heard somebody called a gentleman that
hadn’t any more call to be considered a gentleman
than your pap here. A gentleman, hey?
you mean he has clothes made by a tailor and
money in his pockets, and goes to the barber
frequent, probably takes a bath every day—runnin’
water in his room at home, you guess?
Hum—well—yes—he’s a gentleman ’cording to
them standards. I got my own standard I
measure men by, thank God.”</p>

<p>In his excitement Captain Grif rose from his
chair and limped back and forth on the porch,
thumping his cane down hard at each step. He
went on:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>“Now, Dale, here—<i>he’s</i> a gentleman. You bet
he is. He ain’t got no initial embroidered on <i>his</i>
shirts—ain’t got mor’n two, likely. He ain’t got
no runnin’ water in <i>his</i> house—but he douses himself
in the river every day; and he shaves himself.
It’s some work for <i>him</i> to get himself up presentable.
Tain’t no credit to a feller to keep clean
when he has a shower bath in his closet.” He
was chuckling again, and Wanza ventured to
say:</p>

<p>“I call him a gentleman because—he’s different—that’s
what he is. He don’t talk or look or act
like any one in these parts. I like him. I think
I could earn a bit amusing him when he is able to
sit up, Dad.”</p>

<p>“You’ll march right back home here if I hear
of your tryin’ it, gal, mark me, now!”</p>

<p>“But, Dad, you’re not fair! Why, he may be
the best man living. You haven’t ever laid your
eyes on him.”</p>

<p>“I knows it—I knows it, Wanza. I may
sound a leetle mite prejudiced; but I ain’t—oh,
no! I’m fair-minded; but I’m a reader of character,
and I can tell as much by a man’s nightshirts
as some of these here phrenologists can tell
by the bumps on his head. The minute you said
he had flowers and initials worked on his nightshirts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
that minute I said to myself, ‘He ain’t no
good’; and you mark my words, he ain’t.”</p>

<p>Going home, Wanza said to me:</p>

<p>“Poor Dad, he’s terribly suspicious, ain’t he,
Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“A little, Wanza, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“You’re suspicious, too, David Dale. You
don’t think the big man is a gentleman.”</p>

<p>I considered.</p>

<p>“I think he would be called a gentleman,
Wanza.”</p>

<p>She tossed her head.</p>

<p>“I do think he’s the handsomest man—and the
smartest man, seems! And I like embroidered
underclothes. So there!”</p>

<small>I BEGIN TO WONDER ABOUT WANZA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SOMETIMES I grew perverse, and went
about the tedious common round of my
tread-mill existence doggedly, taking umbrage
at Mrs. Olds for the many unnecessary,
trivial services she exacted. She seemed to delight
in keeping my neck under the yoke. There
was always a door sagging on its hinges, a knife
that needed a new handle, a lamp or two that she
or Wanza had forgotten to fill. The mice that I
took from the traps each morning were legion.
They were Mrs. Olds’ favorite topic of conversation
at breakfast time. How one small cabin
could harbor so fierce and vast a horde I could
scarce conceive. I believe I half suspected Mrs.
Olds of emulating the pied piper, and rounding
them up from the fields and woods. I was appointed
custodian of the wood-rats’ traps, as well.
These were taken alive; and one morning I slyly
let one escape beneath my tormentor’s chair.
Jingles saved the situation by pouncing on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
rodent and snapping his teeth together on its
neck. I came to have small appetite for breakfast.</p>

<p>I began each day by carrying water from the
spring to fill the barrel outside the kitchen door.
Mrs. Olds was apt to mount guard over the barrel
during this period, to see that no earwigs or bits
of leaves went into it from the pail. She was
very particular to have the barrel kept sweet and
clean, and every second day I scrubbed and rinsed
the inside. She required very fine wood for the
kitchen stove for quick fires when she desired to
heat her patient’s food; and for the fireplace in
the front room she asked me to select other wood
than cedar, cedar being prone to crackle and snap.
I was well nigh staggered with the knowledge
of how a woman’s housekeeping differs from a
man’s. Joey and I had felt no lack in the good
old days. I smiled to see my lad’s eyes open
widely at Mrs. Olds’ occasional reference to our
“pitiful attempts at housekeeping.”</p>

<p>“Are our housekeeping pitiful?” he invariably
asked me later.</p>

<p>But though I swallowed my rising gorge, and
managed to work under Mrs. Olds’ coercion,
there was ample time left in which to labor at the
simple tasks I loved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Joey and I had discovered that a pair of
martins were nesting in a hollow tree near the
cabin, and in order to induce other pairs to pass
the summer with us I had decided to erect a few
bird houses on the premises. I was in the Dingle
one evening, therefore, in the act of hoisting a
martin house on a cedar pole, when Joey came
through the elder bushes with his inquisitive small
face in a pucker.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Olds says birds don’t like bird houses,”
he hazarded.</p>

<p>“Indeed?” I murmured.</p>

<p>“Do they, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“I think so, lad.”</p>

<p>“She says she guesses p’haps martins do, mor’n
other birds. Why do martins like bird houses
’specially, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“Why, lad,” I replied, straightening, and taking
my pipe from between my lips, “I think
it is because the Indians, long ago, before the
white man’s time, made snug houses for the
martins out of bark and fastened them to their
tent poles; and accordingly the martins have
grown friendly, and they like us to be hospitable
and prepare a home for them.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to have to coax them,” Joey decided.
“You’re awful good to things, Mr. David—sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
when you coax me, I know I’d ought
to get whipped instead.”</p>

<p>It was the purple gloaming of an unusually
sultry day; and as Joey finished, I looked at my
watch.</p>

<p>“Bed-time, boy,” I announced.</p>

<p>“Hoo—hoo! Hoo—hoo!” he called suddenly,
throwing back his head. His eyes went to the
windows of the cedar room. Soon a faint answering
“Hoo—hoo!” resounded. He sprang
up the steps, and grew hesitant before the closed
door. But in another moment it swung open and
Haidee appeared. She put her arms about the
boyish visitant.</p>

<p>“I’ll kiss you on each eyelid,” I heard her say.
“That means happy dreams. Go to sleep and
dream of ‘Mina, Nainie, and Serena’—oh, I forgot!
They are for little girls’ dreams. What
shall I tell you to dream of?”</p>

<p>“P’r’aps I’ll dream of ‘Dwainies’ and ‘Winnowelvers’—what
lives in Spirkland—an’ all
them things you telled me about, shall I?” Joey
responded chivalrously.</p>

<p>“I think it would be very lovely if you would,”
Haidee’s tender tones replied. And then the kiss
was given—a kiss “like the drip of a drop of
dew.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>I heard Joey’s abashed, “Good night—good
night, Bell Brandon.” Then he beat a hasty
crashing retreat through the underbrush, and my
wonder woman came down the steps and stood at
my side.</p>

<p>“What a glorious sky!” she exclaimed. “Soon
there’ll be a trail of star dust across that mauve
vastness up yonder. I wish I might go down to
the river and see the reflections.”</p>

<p>There was a wistful young note in her voice.</p>

<p>“Nothing easier,” I assured her. “You seem
quite at home on your crutches. I think we can
manage.”</p>

<p>And so it happened that we watched the sun
set together, sitting side by side on the green
plush river bank. It was a gorgeous setting, and
a more gorgeous afterglow. The meadows
across the river were like a wavy robe of pink silk.
The stars crept out and floated low like skimming
butterflies. The river was amber and gold.
Haidee wore the blue robe that I found so distracting.
As she talked, from time to time, she
turned her head and gazed, pensive-eyed, across
the water, and I saw the black loop of her hair,
the line of cheek and throat that moved me to
such profound rapture. I sat there awkward
and tongue-tied while she told me that old Lundquist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
and a couple of hands from the village had
begun repairs at Hidden Lake.</p>

<p>“I have enjoyed your hospitality,” she said
earnestly, “but I must go as soon as the cabin is
in condition. Wanza will go with me. You are
hospitable even to the birds,” she finished smilingly.
“I think you must have Finnish ancestry.”</p>

<p>“My people are Southerners,” I answered,
scarcely thinking of my words.</p>

<p>“How interesting. Did you live in the
South?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Shall you return some day?”</p>

<p>I shrank from her open look. I answered,
“No,” quietly.</p>

<p>Her black-tressed head dipped forward on her
chest and her lips grew mute as if my quick denial
had silenced them. After a long while she said:</p>

<p>“What grand horizons you have in the West.
I grow happier with each sunset that I see.
Look at that fleet of pinkish cloudlets—those
cloud-chariots of fire racing in those pearly
streets.”</p>

<p>“The South cannot compare with the West,” I
said. “Could any one describe this valley?
Only a poet could do it. The summers here!—crisp,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
cool nights for sleep, clear bracing days for
work—”</p>

<p>“And what for relaxation?”</p>

<p>“What do you think?”</p>

<p>“The twilights for relaxation, surely. The
twilights—purple and mysterious. See those
weird trees that leap like twisting flames into the
sky. Look at the river, lovingly clasped in
mountain arms. Listen to the bird-twitterings.
Mr. Dale, what is the bird that sings far into the
night?”</p>

<p>“The bird that says: ‘Sweet, sweet, please
hark to me, won’t you?’”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Something equally plaintive,
at any rate.”</p>

<p>“It’s the white-crowned sparrow. You’ll hear
it through the darkest nights. Its song has all
the sombre quality of the dark hours. It’s our
American nightingale.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Audubon. You know tomes of bird lore,
don’t you? Joey says you are writing a nature
story. I didn’t know the sparrows sang like
nightingales before.”</p>

<p>I smiled down into the engaging face, and then
I threw back my head and whistled. I began
with a rich bell-clear note, this merged into a well
defined melody, and terminated in a pealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
chanson. “The meadow lark,” I said, “which is
not a lark at all, but belongs to the oriole family.
It is an incessant singer.”</p>

<p>“Joey said you whistled like the birds. Why,
you’re a wonder! A craftsman—a fixing man—and—a
bird boy.”</p>

<p>“A bird in the heart is worth more than a hundred
in the note book,” I quoted.</p>

<p>The evening ended all too soon.</p>

<p>Two days later Joey brought me the information
that Haidee was walking about in the
Dingle with the aid of a single crutch.</p>

<p>“An’ she could easily go without that, she says,
Mr. David. An’ she says soon she can send them
to the children’s hospital in the city.”</p>

<p>“Give Bell Brandon my congratulations,” I
bade Joey as I rode away.</p>

<p>I had been to the cabin on Hidden Lake but
once since the accident to my wonder woman. I
had gone there the following day to fetch
Haidee’s mare. Wanza had gone with me and
had brought away a few essential articles of
clothing for her employer.</p>

<p>On my arrival I found that old Lundquist and
the village hands had cleared away the debris, and
that the work of restoring the lean-to was well
under way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>I made a rough draft of the improvements
Haidee and I had planned for the cabin, and
drew up some specifications for the men, and then
I strolled down to the lake. I was saying to myself
that the cabin should be tight and sound for
the fall rains, and that if Haidee would allow
me I would further embellish it with a back porch
and a rustic pergola like the one I had built for
Joey at Cedar Dale, when I heard a splash in
the water, a sudden swishing sound in the rushes,
and saw a movement in the tules. I sprang to
the water’s edge. Soon a canoe emerged from
the green thickets.</p>

<p>Wanza sat in the canoe, plying the paddle. A
triumphant light was on her face, her hands shone
bronze in the sun, her red lips smiled mischievously.
She called to me:</p>

<p>“I’ve run away! I had to get out on the river,
I just had to! Mr. Dale, do you hear the yellow-throat
singing ‘witchery—witchery—witchery’?”</p>

<p>I straightened my shoulders with a quick uplift
of spirit. Her unexpected presence set my
pulses beating a livelier measure. Her cornflower
blue eyes rested on me, then wandered to
the birch thickets along the shore, and she sat
leaning slightly forward, her gaze remote, a
charming figure in the sunlight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Would you like to hear me recite my little
piece about the yellow-throat?”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“While May bedecks the naked trees</div>
<div class="verse">With tassels and embroideries,</div>
<div class="verse">And many blue-eyed violets beam</div>
<div class="verse">Along the edges of the stream,</div>
<div class="verse">I hear a voice that seems to say,</div>
<div class="verse">Now near at hand, now far away,</div>
<div class="verse">‘Witchery—witchery—witchery.’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Her glance came back to me.</p>

<p>“I wish, Mr. Dale, that we had blue violets in
these woods—they all seem to be yellow. Why
do you stare at me so?”</p>

<p>“I had no idea you were coming; it is a stare of
surprise.”</p>

<p>“But you’re glad to see me, now, aren’t you?
I’ll paddle you home. How’s the cabin getting
on?”</p>

<p>“It is scarcely habitable yet. But I think the
men are getting on as well as could be expected.”</p>

<p>Her face was dappled with light and shadow as
she sat there. An exquisite, happy radiance
emanated from her. She looked inquiringly into
my eyes and swept her paddle.</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> surprised to see me, you sure are!
But now that I am here I want to see the improvements.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Give me your hand, David Dale.”</p>

<p>She beached her canoe, stood up, and placed
her hand on my shoulder as I bent to her. Very
lightly I passed my arm about her. She flashed
a laughing side glance at me, and put one foot
over the side of the craft. “I don’t need that
much help,” she said, grimacing.</p>

<p>The canoe rocked, suddenly. She stumbled.
I caught her. She was against my breast.
“You see you needed that much help,” I laughed
boyishly.</p>

<p>“Let me go, Mr. David Dale.”</p>

<p>She shook herself free and stood apart from
me. The sunlight slanted on her face as she
stood there, flushing wildly, gilded her white neck,
flashed on her bare arms. She held her head
down for a moment, and then she raised it and
looked at me. Her eyes were soft and wet.
“What a goose I was,” she cried softly. “Come
on, I’ll race you to the cabin!”</p>

<p>I paddled home in the canoe with Wanza, after
directing Lundquist to ride my horse back to
Cedar Dale. The river purred to us all the way,
the meadow larks and warblers chanted roundelays
of joy and love from the thickets, and the
birch trees shook their silver, tinkling leaves in
elfish music above the sun-kissed water. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
were very silent drifting down the river, and my
thoughts were strange, strange thoughts. I had
begun to wonder about Wanza—Wanza, who understood
my rapture at the sight of the new day,
who felt the same tightening of the throat at the
song of the birds, the same breathlessness beneath
the stars. I had begun to ask myself if, after all,
she were not as fine as another, even though
through long association her rareness for me was
impaired.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>WE HAVE AN ADVENTURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT this time I began to hear strange
stories in the village of a silver-tip bear
that was committing grave depredations
in the community. I recounted exploits of
grizzlies to Haidee and Wanza as we sat in the
Dingle now and then, smiling at Haidee’s delicate
shiver of horror, and glorying in Wanza’s
bravado which led her into all sorts of bombastic
declarations as to what her line of conduct would
be should she meet Mr. Silvertip face to face.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she was fond of repeating, “if I
was carrying a gun I would shoot him.”</p>

<p>Joey kept me awake long after we both should
have been soundly sleeping to tell me how he
would meet the bear in the woods some fine day
when alone, and summarily dispose of him with
the twenty-two calibre rifle he called his own, but
which needless to say, he had never been allowed
to use much. We were all pleasantly excited
anent the grizzly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“I feel sure that it will be my happy fortune
to fire the shot that will bring to an inglorious
end old big foot’s career,” I said dramatically one
morning.</p>

<p>We had foregathered in the Dingle—Haidee’s
mare, Buttons, and Wanza’s Rosebud were
neighing just beyond in the pine thicket—for we
were going to ride. Some days since we had
taken our first jaunt on horseback, and Haidee
had found that the excursion wearied her not at
all. The crutches were infrequently used now.
Haidee explained that her continued use of them
was simply a manifestation of fear-thought. I
little meant the words I said, but when we rode
away I carried my thirty-thirty slung on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>As we went through the village we met Captain
Grif Lyttle mounted on his piebald broncho. It
required no little urging to induce him to join our
expedition. But eventually he was won over.</p>

<p>“If it was goin’ to ride only, I’d be for it. But
I see you’re toting your dinner. I don’t hold
with picnics. This carryin’ grub a few miles—an’
there be <i>nothin’</i> heavier than grub—settin’
down and eatin’ it, and beatin’ it back home, is
all tomfoolishness, ’pears to me. But you young
folks sees things different; and if so be I’ll be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
any acquisition whatsoever to your party, I stand
ready to go along.” He looked hard at Haidee
as he spoke, and I was half prepared for the remark
he addressed to her: “’Pears to me, young
lady, you ain’t got up for a picnic, exactly. That
there gauzy waist’ll snag on the bushes, and your
arms’ll burn to a blister—there’s no protection in
such sleazy stuff. Look at Wanza now—she’s
rigged up proper!—stout skirt and high shoes
and a right thick waist.”</p>

<p>We had gone some distance before I noticed
that Wanza was carrying my twenty-two. I was
not over civil when I saw it in her hands.</p>

<p>“I like to shoot things,” she explained, with a
deprecatory glance.</p>

<p>Captain Grif chuckled.</p>

<p>“Wanza do be the beatenest gal with a gun, if
I do say it,” he remarked.</p>

<p>The glance he leveled at his daughter was
pleased and proud; and there was a depth of
affection in it that was touching.</p>

<p>“Well,” Wanza repeated lightly, “I sure do
like to shoot things.”</p>

<p>“Things!—squirrels, rabbits, birds—what?” I
winked at Captain Grif.</p>

<p>“You know me better than that!” she stormed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Well—the bear, if I meet him alone.”</p>

<p>“With a twenty-two!”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_192.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A SUDDEN YEARNING SPRANG UP</p>

<p>I turned my back on her and spurred forward
to Haidee’s side. Haidee sat her mount superbly.
She wore the blue riding skirt and white
blouse she had worn on the occasion of her first
visit to Cedar Dale. She was hatless. Her hair
was loosely braided. She swayed lightly in her
saddle. There was something bonny, almost insouciant
in her bearing this morning. Wanza
rode beside her father with Joey on the saddle before
her, and they lagged behind Haidee and me
persistently, stopping so often that once or twice
we lost sight of them completely when the road
curved or we dipped down into a hollow. Whenever
I glanced around at Wanza I saw her riding
with her face upturned to the trees, a detached
look on her face. Once I heard her whistle to a
bluebird and once I heard her sing. The pathos
of her song clutched me by the throat. In the
midst of a speech to Haidee I stopped short. In
my heart a sudden yearning sprang up, a yearning
only half understood; I longed to help, to lift
Wanza—to make her more like the woman at my
side—more finished, less elemental. In spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
my wonder and worship of Haidee the pathos of
Wanza’s simple, ignorant life stirred me—yes,
and hurt me!</p>

<p>Nevertheless I was still facetious to Wanza
when we dismounted beneath the shade of some
giant pines at noon. She winced as she unslung
the rifle from her shoulder, and I said teasingly:</p>

<p>“I thought you’d feel the weight of that by
noon.”</p>

<p>Haidee murmured: “You poor thing! Why
did you insist on bringing it?”</p>

<p>I looked across at her sharply. Something in
her manner of speaking caused me to say chivalrously:
“Wanza is welcome to the rifle—it isn’t
that.”</p>

<p>With a quick glance from one to the other
Wanza turned to the saddle bags and began with
Joey’s help, to unpack mysterious looking
bundles. I gathered dry twigs, built a fire between
two flat rocks, and went to a distant spring
for water. Then, a half hour later, the blue
smoke from our fire drifted away among the
pines, and the wind bore the mingled odors of
coffee and sizzling bacon. We sat in a group
around the red tablecloth Wanza spread on the
ground. Captain Grif ate but little, but he discoursed
at large.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>We finished our meal, and lay back on the
grass, and saw the sky, blue above the dark tapestry
of the forest. From reclining I dropped flat
on my back and lay staring up through the chinks
in the green roof, while Haidee read Omar aloud,
Wanza threw pine cones at the chipmunks, Captain
Grif snoozed, and Joey took his bow-gun and
went off on a still hunt for Indians.</p>

<p>An hour passed. When Haidee ceased reading
Wanza sighed and said:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t we eat our lunch closer to the
spring, I’d like to know. I’ll need more water
to wash the forks and spoons before we go.”</p>

<p>I rose with a resigned air. “I will go to the
spring,” I said, taking the small tin pail that had
been used as a coffee boiler. “But understand
we are to have another hour of Omar before we
go—this is an intermission merely.”</p>

<p>The captain opened one eye, and half closing
his big hand made an ineffectual attempt to scoop
a fly into his palm.</p>

<p>“I ’low I don’t understand that fellow Omar—he
don’t sound lucid to me,” he complained. “I
don’t know as I relish bein’ called a Bubble, exactly,
either.” He settled back more comfortably.
“But he was a philosopher, and I’m a
philosopher, so I admire him, and I’ll stand by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
him. All them old chaps was all right ’ceptin’
the lubber that poured treacle on himself to attract
the ants—he was sure peculiar! Get away
there, you fly! Golly, s-ship-mate, <i>flies</i> is bad
enough, but <i>ants</i>!—”</p>

<p>I made quick work of reaching the spring in
spite of the dense underbrush that impeded my
steps. But once there I became enamored of a
reddish-yellow butterfly—Laura, of the genus
Argynnis—and I followed it into a hawthorn
thicket, through the thicket to a tangle of moss-festooned
birches, and eventually lost the specimen
in a dense growth of bramble. I went back
to the spring, filled my pail and was stooping to
drink when I thought I heard a shot. I could not
be certain, as the noise of the water running over
a rock bed filled my ears. But I had gone only a
few yards from the spring and out into a clearing
when I heard unmistakably a shot from my
thirty-thirty. I dropped the pail and ran.</p>

<p>When I came to the pine grove where I had
left Haidee and Wanza and the captain, I saw a
strange sight. Wanza, white-faced and apparently
unconscious, lay in a huddled heap on
the ground, the twenty-two at her side; Haidee
bent over her; the captain stood, wild-eyed, holding
my thirty-thirty in his hand; and near them a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
silver-tip lay bleeding from a wound in his heart.
Even as I went forward to ascertain that the bear
had received his quietus, I spoke to the captain.</p>

<p>“Good work, Captain Grif.”</p>

<p>When I saw that the bear had been dispatched,
I ran back to Wanza’s side. The captain had
lifted her in his arms, her head was against his
breast. The color was coming back to her face.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to shoot a bear again with a twenty-two,
Wanza,” I said, as she unclosed her eyes.
She looked at me strangely and shuddered.
“Some one had to shoot quick, and I had the
twenty-two in my hand.” I would have said
more, but Joey crept out of the bushes, looked at
the bear, then at me, and said:</p>

<p>“Let’s go home, Mr. David.”</p>

<p>When I was preparing Joey for bed that night,
he piped out suddenly: “I saw Wanza shoot the
bear.”</p>

<p>“Wanza?” I turned on him.</p>

<p>“Yep! Sure. I was in the bushes playing
Indian. The bear came out of the huckleberry
bushes in the draw, rolling his head awful. Bell
Brandon she screamed. Whew, she grabbed
Wanza, she did! Captain Grif woke up, and got
only on to his knees—he wobbled so!—and then
Wanza up with the twenty-two and shot—just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
like that! And then she grabbed the big gun and
shot again. Then her father he took the gun
away from her, and Wanza just fell down on the
ground. And then you came.”</p>

<p>That same evening I said to Wanza:</p>

<p>“I was very stupid not to understand that you
shot first with the twenty-two, and then dispatched
the bear with the thirty-thirty. I
thought your father killed the bear. Why did
you not tell me?”</p>

<p>“It didn’t make any difference as I could see
who killed the bear. The main thing was to kill
it,” was the reply I received.</p>

<p>The next day Wanza informed me that Mrs.
Olds’ patient was able to sit up in bed. “I’ve
been talking to him,” she added, with a flirt of her
head. “If I was a good reader, now, I’d be glad
to read to him a bit.”</p>

<p>“I think you are doing very well as you are,
Wanza,” I replied.</p>

<p>There surged through me the instinctive dislike,
almost aversion, I had felt on the night of his
coming to Cedar Dale, and my tone was stern.</p>

<p>“He wants me to talk to him though, he says.
He says he needs perking up. My, he knows a
lot, don’t he, Mr. Dale? Seems like he knows
everything, ’most. And I do think he’s handsome.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
He’s got the finest eyes! Though there’s
something odd about them, too, if you stop to
think. The worst with handsome eyes is that you
<i>don’t</i> stop to think! I’m going out now to get
some hardhack for him. He says he don’t remember
ever seeing the pink kind. What do you
call it, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“Spiraea tomentosa. Wait a bit, Wanza,” I
said, “I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>We went to the woods. It was morning, and
the freshness of the hour was incomparable. The
birds were singing with a sort of rapture. And
our way through the silent greenwood aisles was
wholesome and sweet with the breath of pine and
balm o’ Gilead. The vistas were rosy with pink
hardhack; on either side feathery white clusters
of wild clematis festooned the thickets, and here
and there the bright faces of roses peeped out at
us from tangles of undergrowth.</p>

<p>I know not what spirit of willfulness possessed
Wanza. I think she had it in her mind to arouse
my jealousy by praise of the big man. Her talk
was all of him. Finally I had my say.</p>

<p>“I know nothing of him, Wanza. He may be
a splendid chap, of course, and he may be a rascal.
Frankly, I do not like him. Admire him, if
you want to. But I would rather you did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
chat with him unless Mrs. Olds is present.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! How can a little friendly chat
hurt any one.”</p>

<p>Wanza tucked a wild rose into her curls, and
it hung pendent, nodding at me saucily, as she
tossed her head and laughed in my face. Her
cheeks matched the flower in color. I looked at
her admiringly, but my voice was still firm as I
said: “I hope you will be careful to give very
little of your time to Mrs. Olds’ patient.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha,” laughed Wanza, crinkling her eyelids
and giving me an elfish glance from beneath
tawny lashes.</p>

<p>“In a measure,” I continued, “you are in my
care, and I feel responsible for your associates
while you are with me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Wanza, “if I’m with an angel
’most all day and all the night—meaning Mrs.
Batterly—it sure won’t hurt me to talk some to
a sinner like the big man. Besides, it’ll help out
a lot. It’ll keep me from getting glum, Mr.
Dale.” She favored me with another roguish
glance. “You wouldn’t have me getting glum,
would you?”</p>

<p>“I wish the big man were well, and on his way,
so that we might use the front room again. Mrs.
Batterly has only her room and the Dingle as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
is, and she must grow tired of having her meals
in her room,” I complained.</p>

<p>“I carried her breakfast to her this morning in
the Dingle.” There was something defiant in
the girl’s tone.</p>

<p>“Famous!” I cried.</p>

<p>After a short silence Wanza said provokingly:</p>

<p>“If I want to talk to the big man and Mrs.
Olds is out of ear shot I don’t see as it can
matter.”</p>

<p>“Please, Wanza,” I insisted, “talk with him as
little as possible.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were laughing, and teasing and pacifying
all at one and the same time. I held out
my hand.</p>

<p>“Say you will do as I ask, and give me your
hand on it,” I implored.</p>

<p>Her eyes were only teasing now. She shook
her head, and I dropped my hand and turned
away. I heard a rustling among the grasses and
thought she had gone. But when after taking a
few steps I looked around, there she was, perched
on a boulder, her feet drawn up beneath her pink
gingham skirt, her arms crossed on her breast,
her eyes surveying me steadfastly. I did not
smile as I faced her. I merely glanced and
swung on my heel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Come here,” she called.</p>

<p>When I was close beside her again she shook
her head more vehemently than before, until all
her tiny tight curls bobbed up and down distractingly.</p>

<p>“It won’t do,” she said.</p>

<p>“What won’t do?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Your trying to boss me won’t do, my trying
to pretend won’t do.”</p>

<p>“What are you trying to pretend, Wanza?”</p>

<p>“That I’m crazy about the big man. I ain’t.”</p>

<p>“Oh? Well, I really would have no right to
object if you found him attractive. I dare say
I have seemed rather dictatorial,” I answered
chivalrously.</p>

<p>“And something else won’t do.”</p>

<p>“Pray tell me what it is.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do for you to pretend, either.”</p>

<p>“I? What do I pretend?”</p>

<p>She eyed me gravely, pulled a blade of grass,
blew on it, and cast it aside.</p>

<p>“Lot of things,” she said then.</p>

<p>“Do I, Wanza?”</p>

<p>“But I can stand anything—anything,” she
threw out both hands, “except being bossed. I
can’t stand that.”</p>

<p>“No one could,” I agreed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>“And you mustn’t try it on, because if you
do!—me and you will part company.”</p>

<p>I was surprised at the hard glint in her eyes,
the inflexible tone of her voice. Her face was
quite unlovely at that moment.</p>

<p>“Child, child,” I began impulsively, but I
hesitated and said nothing more, for her eyes with
their strange hardness seemed the eyes of a
stranger.</p>

<p>The crisp, blue morning paved the way to a hot,
still day. I drove to the village for supplies in
the afternoon, and after supper I was glad to
rest on the river bank, with Joey sprawling on
the grass at my side. The moon rose early and
climbed into the purple pavilion above us, spraying
the world with a wash of gold. The night
became serene, almost solemn; one big, bright star
burst upon our sight from the top of a low ridge
of hills opposite, and threw a linked, sliding silver
bridge from one plush river bank to the other.
It looked like some strange aerial craft fired with
unearthly splendor, and propelled by unguessed
sorcery. I was glad to forget the tawdry,
painted day that was slipping into the arms of
night. It had been a fretting day in many particulars.
My morning with Wanza had irked
me, I had had almost no conversation with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
Haidee, and Mrs. Olds had been exceedingly arbitrary
during the evening meal in the hot, stuffy
little kitchen. The calm evening hour was like
a benediction to me, and Joey’s tender little hand
stroking mine soothed me inexpressibly.</p>

<p>I was hoping to escape without the usual sleep-time
story, but one glance at the eager face
showed me that the lad was eagerly expecting its
spinning. And his first words were evidently
meant to act as an impetus.</p>

<p>“If you was to tell me a story, Mr. David,
would it be a fairy one, do you think? Or would
it be about a bear, do you ’spose, or a—a tiger?”</p>

<p>I am afraid I spoke rather impatiently.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you tired of bears and tigers yet,
Joey?”</p>

<p>A wistful voice replied:</p>

<p>“Did you get tired of ’em when you was little,
Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I answered hastily, “of course, I did
not.”</p>

<p>The lad rolled over until his brown head rested
against my knee.</p>

<p>“To-night I’d liever hear about fairies.”</p>

<p>“Honestly, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Yep! Criss cross my heart and hope to die.
I like to hear about Dwainies.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“Who calls them Dwainies?”</p>

<p>“Her—Bell Brandon.”</p>

<p>The dear homey name! I smiled down into the
boy’s brown eyes. Suddenly it seemed to me that
I should enjoy a talk about Dwainies.</p>

<p>“Well,” I began, “I shall tell you a story of a
Dwainie called Arethusa. Say it after me, Joey.
Arethusa.”</p>

<p>“Arethusa,” he repeated painstakingly.</p>

<p>“Arethusa was a nymph. She lived in a place
called Arcadia. And she slept on a couch of
snow in the Acroceraunian mountains. Don’t
interrupt, please, Joey!—”</p>

<p>“I was only trying to say that big word—it’s
hard enough to say the name of our own mountains—but
Ac—Acro—”</p>

<p>“Never mind. It is not necessary for you to
remember all the names in my stories, only the
names I ask you to remember.”</p>

<p>“Bell Brandon says you’re teaching me funny
that way. She says you’re teaching me stories of
the old world before you teach me to speak good
English. What’s good English, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, lad,” I murmured confusedly.
My wonder woman was quite right, Joey’s English
was reprehensible; but I confess I secretly
enjoyed it—there was something eminently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
Joeyish about it—a quaintness that I found irresistible.
I smiled, and sighed, and continued,
“Arethusa’s hair was rainbow colored, and her
eyes were sky blue, and her cheeks coral. Gliding
and springing she went, ever singing; you
see, she was not only beautiful, but light hearted
and pure. The Earth loved her, and the Heaven
smiled above her. Now Alpheus was a river-god.
He sat very often on a glacier—a cold, cold
glacier, and whenever he struck the mountains
with his trident great chasms would open, and the
whole world about would shake. He saw the
Dwainie Arethusa, one day, and as she ran he
followed the fleet nymph’s flight to the brink of
the Dorian sea.”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh,” breathed my listener, eyes distended,
and lips apart. “Did he catch her?”</p>

<p>“He followed her to the brink—the edge, Joey—of
the sea. Arethusa cried: ‘Oh, save me!
Oh, guide me! And bid the deep hide me, for he
grasps me now by the hair—’”</p>

<p>“Her rainbow hair?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,—don’t interrupt.”</p>

<p>“Who did she yell to?”</p>

<p>“The loud Ocean heard. It stirred, and divided—parted,
boy—and ‘under the water the
Earth’s white daughter fled like a sunny beam.’”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>“Hm! What did the river-god do then?”</p>

<p>“He pursued her. He descended after her.
‘Like a gloomy stain on the emerald main.’”</p>

<p>“But did he get her, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“Well, Arethusa was changed into a stream by
Diana, and the stream was turned into a fountain
in the island of Ortygia, and Alpheus the river-god
still pursuing her, finally won her, and they
dwelt single-hearted in the fountains of Enna’s
mountains.”</p>

<p>There was a burst of roguish laughter behind
me.</p>

<p>“What a classic tale for a child mind,” a light
voice cried.</p>

<p>Haidee stood among the shadows of the cottonwoods,
swaying between her crutches.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Olds has sent me in search of you. The
canteen you soldered for her patient’s use has
come unsoldered, the tin lining of the fireless
cooker has sprung a leak, the big man has to be
lifted while his bed is being changed, and she
wants to know if you forgot to purchase the
malted milk this afternoon—she can’t find it anywhere.
She said, too, that you had signified your
intention of rubbing soap on the doors to prevent
their squeaking. She also said something about
procrastination, but it sounded hackneyed—quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
as if I had heard it somewhere before—so I left
rather precipitately.”</p>

<p>All the while I was soldering the canteen for
the big man’s feet, I could hear Wanza chattering
blithely with the patient in the front room. She
came out to me after awhile, and stood at my
elbow as I examined the cooker. I frowned at
her, and received a moue in return.</p>

<p>“I’ve been telling the big man about my
peddler’s cart,” she ventured finally. “He’s so
set on seeing it, soon as he’s well enough! Seems
he never saw one. He can’t talk much, he’s that
weak yet—like a baby! But I can talk to him.”</p>

<p>“I shall not ask you not to talk with him, again,
Wanza,” I announced.</p>

<p>“It’s just as well, seeing as I know what I’m
about. Land! the poor man! He needs some
one to talk to him. I don’t notice you hurting
yourself seeing after him, Mr. David Dale!”</p>

<p>I felt very weary and intolerably disgusted
with everything, and I answered sharply, “That’s
my own affair.” The next minute I saw the
blood spurt from my palm, and realized even as
Wanza cried out that I had cut myself rather
badly on the tin lining of the cooker. I turned
faint and dizzy, and opening the door I plunged
out into the night air followed closely by Wanza.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“It’s nothing,” I kept saying, keeping my
hand behind me as she would have examined it.</p>

<p>“Please—please, Mr. Dale, let me look at it.”</p>

<p>She pressed forward to my side and reached
around behind me for my hand. I could feel her
quivering in every limb.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” I maintained, though the pain
was intense, and the rapid flow of blood was
weakening me.</p>

<p>“It is something. Oh, if only to be kind to
me, Mr. Dale, let me have your hand!”</p>

<p>We struggled, my other arm went around her,
and I attempted to draw her back and sweep
her around to my uninjured side. I was obstinate
and angry, and she was persistent and
tearful, and we wrestled like two foolish children.
“Please, please,” she kept repeating, and I reiterated,
“No.” It must have looked uncommonly
like a love scene to a casual onlooker,
and Haidee’s voice speaking through the dusk
gave me an odd thrill.</p>

<p>“I have called and called you, Wanza,” she
was saying. “Will you go to Mrs. Olds, please?
I think she wants water from the spring, or the
malted milk prepared, or—or something equally
trivial.”</p>

<p>I released my prisoner and she sped away. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
was left to peer through the darkness at Haidee
and vainly conjure my mind for something to
say. The drip, drip of the blood from my cut
on to the maple leaves at my feet, gave me a disagreeable
sensation. I felt weakened, and slow
in every pulse. I thought of words, but had no
will to voice them, and so I stood staring stupidly
at the vision before me. She spoke with a
strange little gasp in her voice at last.</p>

<p>“I think I have been mistaken in you, Mr.
Dale.”</p>

<p>“You are making a mistake now,” I replied
hoarsely. There was a peculiar singing in my
ears, and a buzzing in my brain where small
wheels seemed to be grinding round, so that my
tone was not convincing, and as I spoke I leaned
my shoulder against a tree from sheer weakness.
In my own ears my words sounded shallow and
ineffectual. I tried to speak again but succeeded
in making only a clicking sound in my
throat. I felt myself slipping weakly lower and
lower, though I dug my feet into the turf and
braced my knees heroically. Faster and faster
the wheels went round. I felt that Haidee was
moving toward the cabin away from me. I tried
to call her name. But I was floundering in a
quagmire of unreality; I groped in a dubious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
morass darkly, straining toward the light. My
knees felt like pulp, they yielded completely and
I slid ignominiously to the ground, rolled over,
and lay inert, waves of darkness washing over
me.</p>

<p>It was Joey who found me, whose tears on my
face aroused me. His grief was wild. His
lamentations echoed around me. He was moaning
forth: “Mr. David, Mr. David,” in a
frenzy, laying his face on mine, patting my
cheeks, lifting my eyelids with trembling fingers.
“Are you killed? Are you killed?” I heard him
wail. “Oh dear, dear, my own Mr. David,
please open your eyes and speak to Joey!”</p>

<p>A light from a lantern struck blindingly into
my eyes as I unclosed them and I quickly lowered
my lids. But my lad had seen the sign of life
and I heard him call: “Wanza, Wanza, come
quick! Mr. David is laying here all bloody and
hurted.”</p>

<p>I struggled to a sitting posture as Wanza
came forward at a run, swinging her lantern. A
few minutes later I sat on a bench in the workshop
while Wanza bathed and dressed my hand
and gave me a sip of brandy from a bottle she
found in the cupboard over one of the small
windows. I was ashamed of my weakness and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
apologized for it, explaining that I had never
been able to endure the sight of blood with fortitude,
and admitting that the tin had cut rather
deep.</p>

<p>“Now you just crawl into bed and go to sleep
and forget all about it,” she crooned, mothering
me, with a gentle hand on my hair. She went to
my bunk in the corner, shook up the pillows and
straightened the blankets, and catching up the
pail of water filled the basin on the wash-bench.
“Wash your face and hands, you Joe,” she ordered.
“Then come outside and I’ll hear you say
your prayers.”</p>

<p>I was lying in my bunk half asleep, though
tortured by the remembrance of Haidee’s words,
when I heard the following oddly disjointed
prayer from the river bank.</p>

<p>“Now I lay me—Oh, God, thank you for not
letting Mr. David bleed to death—I pray the
Lord—’Cause if he had bled to death I’d want
to die too—my soul to keep—he’s all I got, and
I want to thank you for him, God— Wait,
Wanza, this is a new prayer I’m saying! I am
going to ask God to bless you, too. Bless
Wanza, please, God,—but bless Mr. David the
most,—oh, the most of anybody in the whole
world! Amen.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>Soon Joey came pattering in to the shop and
very gingerly crawled in beside me. He was
asleep, and I was lying miserably brooding,
when Wanza called softly just outside the window:
“Mr. Dale—hoo-hoo!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wanza?” I answered.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to the cabin—in the cedar room—talking
with Mrs. Batterly. I told her all about
your cutting your hand, and—and how you would
not let me look at it—and how silly I was, trying
to make you—when she come up. I told her how
I found you on the ground—and—and everything.
Go to sleep now.”</p>

<p>“I shall, Wanza. Thank you,” I cried gratefully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>THE DREAM IN THE DINGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A FEW days later I was summoned to the
big man’s side as he sat, fully dressed
for the first time, outside the cabin in the
shade of a cedar. I sat beside him while he
thanked me for my hospitality, and said it was
his intention to push on to Roselake and thence
to Wallace that very afternoon.</p>

<p>“I have business to transact there for my
partner, Dick Bailey, who died in Alaska last
winter,” he said, and stopped short, looking at
me with a sudden question in his eyes. “By the
bye, you people seem to be laboring under the
impression that my name is Bailey,” he added.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Olds found the name on a pocketbook
you carried,” I explained.</p>

<p>“To be sure—I was carrying an old wallet of
Bailey’s. Our initials are the same, too.” He
fell to musing, wrinkling his brows. But instead
of telling me his name, he went on presently:
“You are master of a somewhat unusual household,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
Dale. I am vastly interested. You’re a
lucky dog to have such a Hebe for a protégée as
the girl Wanza, such an infant prodigy as that
young scamp, who shows fine discrimination, and
glowers at me from the kitchen door, for an
adopted son,—and who is the interesting lady
patient on whom Wanza waits and who is shut
up in a Blue Beard’s closet next my room? I
have a sly sure instinct that tells me she is the
most wonderful of the lot.”</p>

<p>The blood rushed to my face. The leer with
which he accompanied his words was rakish, and
his handsome face smirked disgustingly.</p>

<p>“She is an unfortunate neighbor of mine, who
was crippled by a falling tree the night of the
storm,” I answered coldly.</p>

<p>He gave me a quizzical glance, shrugged his
shoulders, and exclaimed laughingly:</p>

<p>“Beauty in distress! Don Quixote to the
rescue. You’re the sort of chap, I fancy, Dale,
who goes about tilting at windmills. You belong
to a past generation. But it is lucky for
me I stumbled across you. Well, I care not to
pry into your Blue Beard’s closet—the girl
Wanza is a piquant enough little devil for me—”</p>

<p>“Just speak more respectfully of her, if you
must speak at all,” I interrupted with heat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“Don Quixote, Don Quixote,” he murmured,
wagging a broad finger at me, and shaking his
head playfully.</p>

<p>I said something beneath my breath, and rose
from my chair hastily.</p>

<p>“Wait! Wait!” he cried. “Don’t let your
choler rise. Sit down. We will not discuss the
ladies. I was about to tell you my name, and
give you my credentials—”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly. Joey was issuing
from the elder bushes piping on his flute. As I
listened, a voice from the Dingle caught up the
refrain, a voice high and sweet and clear.</p>

<p class="center">“Bell Brandon was the birdling of the mountains—”</p>

<p>The line ended in a ripple of laughter. The
man before me half raised in his seat. Then
sweeter and lower:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“And I loved the little beauty, Bell Brandon—</div>
<div class="verse">And she sleeps ’neath the old arbor tree.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The underbrush parted and Haidee came
toward us, leaning slightly on one crutch. In
her hand she carried a great bunch of pink spirea.
Each cheek was delicately brushed with color, her
star-eyes were agleam, her lips curved with
laughter.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>And then, all suddenly, the dimples and
laughter and life fled from her beautiful face, her
eyes turned dull and anguished. She was looking
at the big man, and he was looking at her.
His pasty face was gray as ashes. His little eyes
contracted to pin-points.</p>

<p>Haidee’s dry lips writhed apart. One word
dropped from them:</p>

<p>“You!”</p>

<p>She crouched forward, peered at him intently
through the soft green shadows of the cedars, her
eyes growing bigger as if wild with a sudden hope
that they might have played her a trick. And
then gradually the intentness left them, they
hardened, and her whole face stiffened, and grew
white and grim.</p>

<p>The big man had risen. He took a step forward
now. There was something bullying in his
attitude, something implacable in his altered face.
His light eyes had a sinister gleam, but his <i>savoir-faire</i>
did not desert him. He spoke to me, but
his eyes never left the marble face of the woman
who confronted him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dale,” he said with a wave of the hand,
“pardon our agitation. I am Randall Batterly.
This is the first time my wife and I have met in
five years.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>I reached Haidee’s side just in time, for the
crutch slipped from her grasp, and she would
have fallen but for my steadying arm.</p>

<p>Joey, the dauntless, sprang forward and
menaced the big man with threatening, childish
fist. “You leave my Bell Brandon alone!” he
screamed, “you leave her alone—you big, bad
man! I wish we’d let you die, I do.”</p>

<p>I placed Haidee in a chair. I took Joey’s
hand and led him indoors. I heard a wild cry
ring out:</p>

<p>“I thought you were dead in the Yukon, Randall
Batterly, I thought you were dead. I hate
you! I hate you!”</p>

<p>I closed the door on her agonized weeping.</p>

<p>Before the big man left that day he sent Wanza
to ask me to come to him in the living room. I
was in my workshop, and I shook my head when
the message was delivered. In the mood I was
in then it was well for me not to go to him. I
shall never forget the expression on Mrs. Olds’
face when she sought me in the shop a half hour
later to bid me good-bye. She had found, at last,
food for her prying, suspicious mind.</p>

<p>“I am that shocked and surprised, Mr. Dale!”
she gasped, all of a flutter. “Why, I’m just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
trembly! I heard high voices, and I stole out on
the porch, and there they were, saying such
dreadful, dreadful things to each other! And
isn’t it odd, Mr. Dale, that they should come together
here in this remote—I was going to say
God forsaken—spot, this way? Now, don’t you
suppose they will patch up their differences? I
should think they might—they’re young folks—it
seems a pity the amount of domestic infelicity
nowadays—and they are a likely fine looking
couple.” She drew breath, shook her head, and
paused dramatically.</p>

<p>I felt her fish-eyes searching my face.</p>

<p>Then she broke out, as I maintained an apparently
unruffled front:</p>

<p>“Of course, Mr. Dale, it is not for me to say
all I think—not for me to say whose is the fault.
But I must say I am surprised and disappointed—yes,
and shocked—shocked, Mr. Dale, that
Mrs. Batterly, a married woman, should proclaim
herself a widow. When a woman will do that—why,
what is one to think! I can’t abide duplicity.
To my notion there is absolutely no excuse
for that, Mr. Dale. And if she did not
know her husband was alive—well, I have no
words.”</p>

<p>I was sullen-hearted enough, God knows, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
Mrs. Olds’ inane, arrogant drivel was like tinder
on a blown fire. I was wild as an enraged bull
who has the red scarf flaunted in his long suffering
face. I thrust out my chin and I squared my
shoulders, and I know my face must have grown
ugly with my red-eyed anger.</p>

<p>If I had spoken then, I am sure Mrs. Olds
could have guessed most accurately at the state
of my heart with regard to Haidee. But just at
that moment the cedar waxwing left its cage,
circled about my head, and descended to settle in
the crook of my arm. I straightened my arm,
and it hopped to my outspread palm, looking up
at me with pert, bright eyes. In that short space
during which the bird poised there, I thought of a
hundred poignant things to say to Mrs. Olds.
But the bird flew away and I said not one of
them.</p>

<p>After I had bidden good-bye to Mrs. Olds
there was Wanza still to be reckoned with. I had
just seen from my window the flurried departure
of the nurse and her patient on the afternoon
stage when I heard a tentative voice at my elbow,
murmur: “Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>I am sure there must have been a certain fierceness
in my bearing as I wheeled about. But I
was all unprepared for the fervid face that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
lips almost brushed as I turned, the depth of
emotion in the burningly blue eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she breathed, as I faced her. “Don’t,
please!”</p>

<p>“Don’t what, child?” I articulated.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me so sharp—so awful!” Her
voice thinned, as if she were going to cry. Her
brown, pleading hands came out to me. “I only
want to say good-bye.”</p>

<p>As I still stood woodenly, looking at her, she
moved back with a swift jerk of her slim body
and put her hands behind her. Her face altered.
It whitened, and she let her lids droop over eyes
suddenly hot with resentment. Feeling like a
brute I made haste to intercept the hands. I
slipped my arms about her, caught the hands, and
drew them around against my chest. I think I
had never liked Wanza better than at that
moment in her hurt pride, and womanliness.</p>

<p>“Dear Wanza,” I said, “my dear child—”</p>

<p>She pressed against me suddenly, and put her
soft cheek against my sleeve.</p>

<p>“What is it, child, what is it?” I begged. I
put my hand gently on her hair.</p>

<p>“I’m going away, Mr. Dale—I’m going! I
been so happy here—with you and Joey and the
birds.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>Her breaths were sobs.</p>

<p>It was my turn to say “Don’t!” I said it imploringly,
and I added: “I cannot bear to see
you cry, Wanza.”</p>

<p>“Oh, let me cry! I’m upset, and nervous, and—and
sad—I guess you’d call it. I’m going on
home now, and set things to rights a bit, and to-night
I’m going to Hidden Lake to stay with
Mrs. Batterly. I promised.”</p>

<p>“She needs you, Wanza,” I said.</p>

<p>“I was to ask you if you would ride through
the woods with her, in a half hour. She’s not
quite fit to go alone, Mr. Dale.” Suddenly
Wanza broke into a tempest of tears, and sobbed
and shook, huddled against my shoulder, stammering:
“Everything is upside down—upside
down! But—yes, Mr. Dale, I am glad—glad—that
Mrs. Batterly has got a husband living.
He’s probably a bad man, and if she wanted to
run away it was all right and nobody’s business.
But it had to come out that she had a husband,
and I’m glad it’s come—that’s all! I’m glad it’s
come—now—afore—”</p>

<p>I looked down at the opulent fleece of hair
spinning into artless spirals of maze against my
shoulder, and I threaded a curl through my
fingers absently before I probed this significant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
stumbling final sentence. Then I caught at the
lost word. “Before, Wanza? Before—what!”</p>

<p>“Before you got to thinking too much of her.”</p>

<p>I laughed. I stood away from the child and
laughed ironically. The laugh saved the situation.
Wanza raised her head, gave a watery
smile, and flung out.</p>

<p>“You needn’t laugh. You were thinking too
much of her—you know you was.”</p>

<p>“Please, Wanza,—don’t!”</p>

<p>“Now your face is black again.” Wanza’s
mood changed swiftly. “Oh, Mr. Dale, I have a
weight here,” she laid her hand on her chest. “I
feel things pressing,—awful things! What’s going
to happen, do you think, that I feel so queer
and blue and bad?”</p>

<p>I shook my head. She went on quickly:</p>

<p>“Of course I’m broke up about leaving Cedar
Dale just now, I just can’t bear to quit you
and Joey—and the birds—and squirrels—and
flowers—”</p>

<p>The tears were brimming up again in the
velvet-blue eyes. I walked over to the waxwing’s
cage, snapped shut the door on the tiny
prisoner, and handed the cage to Wanza.</p>

<p>“Take him with you,” I bade her.</p>

<p>With the cage clasped in her arms, her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
flooded with tears, but with smiles on her mobile
lips, she went from the shop, backward, step by
step.</p>

<p>After Wanza came Joey. A transfigured
Joey. Wild with rage at the big man, threatening,
and bombastic. Then softening into plaintive
grief, wailing:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. David, my Bell Brandon’s going!
She’s going! She won’t be here to-night for
my sleep-time story. She won’t be here when I
wake up to-morrow. She won’t ever stay here
again.”</p>

<p>“No, lad,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Won’t she, don’t you ’spose? P’r’aps if she
don’t like it at Hidden Lake she’ll come back.
Don’t you think she’ll come again, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“No,” I repeated, sadly.</p>

<p>He sniffled. Then he said, in a frightened
tone, “Wanza ain’t going too, is she?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Joey.”</p>

<p>He drew his sleeve across his eyes. He
swallowed. Then he said, winking hard, “I’ll
miss Bell Brandon, but I’ll miss Wanza most.”</p>

<p>After a moment, I ventured:</p>

<p>“You have me, Joey.”</p>

<p>He drew his sleeve across his eyes again,
gulped, and muttered:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>“I’m ’shamed. I love you most! But she’s
mothery—Wanza is, that’s it!”</p>

<p>Mothery—Wanza of the wind’s will—mothery!</p>

<p>I keep a picture still in my mind of that last day
on which I rode through the forest with Haidee to
Hidden Lake. Rain had drenched the earth the
previous night, and though the sun smiled from a
cloudless sky, the roads were heavy and our
horses’ progress slow. There was a languid
drowsiness in the air, enhanced by the low, incessant
singing of cat-bird, robin and lark, and
the overpowering scent of syringa and rose. We
chose a shadowy trail, and our heads were brushed
by white-armed flowery hawthorns, while honeysuckle
threw fragrant tendrils across our way.
The woods glowed emerald-green, and dappled
gray, gemmed here and there with dogwood;
great plumes of spirea rose like pink clouds in the
purple vistas. Small hollows held crystal-clear
water, and up from these hollows floated swarms
of azure butterflies. We crossed a swift-running
stream; and before us, between smooth, mossy
banks fern-topped, lay a cup-like dell, shut in by
shrubs and vines. I drew rein, and dismounted,
and Haidee with a swift glance at my face drew
in her mare.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>I went to her side.</p>

<p>She held some purple flowers in the bend of
her arm, flowers that Joey had given her, she
fingered the petals with a caressing touch. Her
head drooped slightly, but her eyes met mine
questioningly. The pallor of her face but made
it more exquisite. Her gown was gray. Its
folds rippled about her slight form. She seemed
like some grave-eyed spirit. Her hair was in
braids, outlining the ivory of her face. A scarf
of white muslin left her warm throat bare.</p>

<p>I strove for words. But I could only whisper:</p>

<p>“I am your friend. Never forget. If danger
ever threatens you—”</p>

<p>“If danger ever threatened me, I believe that
you would intervene—you are a brave man,
David Dale. But I shall live safely—going on
with my even life—in my little cabin, with good
Wanza for a companion. I have had a shock,
Mr. Dale,” her voice quivered, her lips whitened
with the words, “oh, such a shock! It is better
not to speak of it. Not at least unless I tell
you all there is to tell, and I am not ready as yet
to do that.” She struggled with herself. She
drew a deep breath. “But I came here to work!
I shall work as I have planned until autumn, then—well,
I do not know what then. You heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
much yesterday—you know my attitude toward
the man who is my husband. I dare say you are
shocked, and shaken in your chivalrous estimate
of me. I cannot help that. I do not feel that
I can explain—it goes too deep. It is not to be
laid bare before—forgive me—a stranger.”</p>

<p>She smiled at me sadly as if to soften the last
words. But hurt and amazed, I cried:</p>

<p>“A stranger! Am I that?”</p>

<p>A light sprang into her eyes, the red came into
her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Forgive me,” she said again.</p>

<p>“I am your friend—your true friend—no
stranger.” I held out my hand. “I thought you
understood.”</p>

<p>She kept her eyes upon me, but did not seem
to see me. They were hunted, weary eyes; weary
to indifference, I saw suddenly. And seeing this
I took her slim fingers in mine and pressed them
very gently and let them go.</p>

<p>Suddenly her composure broke. She turned
whiter, she could scarcely breathe. She moved
her head restlessly. “I can’t bear it—I can’t—I
can’t! I wish I might fly to the ends of the earth—but
there’s no escape.” She brushed her hand
across her face. She cowered in her saddle.
“It’s awful! I thought he was gone forever—forever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
do you understand? Oh, the freedom,
the rest—the peace! With his return has come
the shadow of an old, old grief. It blots out the
sunshine.”</p>

<p>My lips twitched as I attempted soothing
words. I took her cold hands and chafed them.
“Courage,” I whispered. She shook her head,
quivering, panting and undone.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was born to live! Courage? I have
none!”</p>

<p>She leaned forward and sunk her head on the
pommel of the saddle. After a time she swung
toward me. Her hair swept about her flaming
cheeks, and veiled her burning eyes. She looked
like some hunted wild thing.</p>

<p>“I hate him,” she hissed. “He knows I hate
him. He does not care.”</p>

<p>We looked at each other.</p>

<p>“But he cares for you,” I stated.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said, hastily, “don’t say that.”</p>

<p>Again we scanned each other’s faces. I spoke
impetuously:</p>

<p>“You believe in Destiny. Well, so do I!
But we are not weak instruments. You know
what I mean. What law of society compels you
to a bondage such as you hint at? You are a
strong-minded woman. Now that you know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
worst you have weapons to fight with. As soon
as you look about you—when you come to face
the facts, you will see this.” I struggled with
my thoughts, then I threw wide my arms. “God
knows what I am to say to you!”</p>

<p>She lifted up her head. “I have promised him
to do nothing—to go on as I have been—he will
not molest me.”</p>

<p>I half shrugged. “He loves you; of course,
you believe that.”</p>

<p>“He may. He protested that he did, when I
told him I must go my way.”</p>

<p>I heard her dully, my eyes on her face. She
said a few more words brokenly, that I scarce
gave ear to. At the conclusion of them I looked
away to the purple wood vista. “Why did it
please God,” I said, “to have you cross my path!”</p>

<p>Tears filled her eyes. “Those words did not
sound like the words of a friend.”</p>

<p>“But they are said.” I moved away, she sat
brooding. I mounted, and came to her side.
“We are friends, we may be friends, surely!
May I come to see you?”</p>

<p>“Indeed you must come. Your visits will be
welcome.” She smiled, but her smile was twisted
and dubious. “I expect great things of Wanza.
She will be my entertainer. She will cheer me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
Have Joey come to me—” Her voice failed her
utterly. She was pale again as the syringa
blooms at her side.</p>

<p>“We must push on, now,” I said.</p>

<p>She gathered up her reins.</p>

<p>And so we rode side by side to the little shack
on the shore of Hidden Lake. But when she
gave me her hand at parting, I stumblingly cried:
“If he had not come—if he had not come, I should
have tried to win your love!” Something in her
eyes caused me to add: “I wonder if I should
have succeeded.”</p>

<p>She paled and drew her hand from mine. “I
could have loved you, David Dale,” she
whispered.</p>

<p>That night when Joey was preparing for bed
in the cedar room, I spied a bit of ribbon the color
of the gowns Wanza wore, wreathed in among
the grasses in the magpie’s cage. And at the
sight Joey cried out:</p>

<p>“That’s Wanza’s. I want her! I want her to
come back and stay, I do.”</p>

<p>Holding the ribbon in my hand, I passed out
to the Dingle.</p>

<p>Here I sat down on the stump by the pool, in
a ring of black shadow cast by the cedars, and
lifted my face to the stars that were shining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
through the wattled green roof above my head.
I was worn, physically and mentally, by the experiences
of the day. I sat there stupidly, scarce
moving, letting my pipe go out as I fed my grief
with memories. Joey called out at intervals:
“Good night, Mr. David, dear.” Each time I
responded: “Good night, Joey.” At last no
sound came from the cedar room. I knew he
slept. It was very still in the Dingle. A toad
hopped across the stone walk and a grass-snake
flashed through the rose hedge, like a quick flame.
Close to the pool’s brink the big flag-flowers vacillated
in a faint, upspringing breeze, and the
rushes swayed and shuddered above the timorous
bluebells. The moon came up slowly, and I saw
its face through the tree spaces. I wondered if
Haidee were watching it from the shore of Hidden
Lake. And then a naked Desolation crept
up out of an unknown void, and I saw the gleam
of its whitened bones. It gibed me. It trailed
its bleached carcass across my arid path. The
hour grew hideous. I felt myself alone—grievously
alone—on the verge of utmost solitude,
reaching out ineffectual hands toward
emptiness. I recoiled, my senses whirling, from
the limitless nothingness into which my vision
pored.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>I was clammy, with a cold sweat. My throat
was dry. But the horror passed and I grew
apathetic at length, and sodden. Then calm,
merely. Soon I grew strangely somnolent. I
nodded. But after a space I sat tense, my chin
sunk, listening. A vague stirring in the night
chilled my blood, and at the same time thrilled
me. I listened and watched, breathing heavily,
alert and narrow-eyed.</p>

<p>And then!</p>

<p>I saw Wanza part the tangles of syringa, and
stand pink-robed, framed in white blossoms.
Her face, rose-tinted and impassioned, was curtained
on either side by her unbound resplendent
hair. Her eyes, laughing and bright like happy
stars, shone through the wilderness of locks.
Her lips, smooth and pink as polished coral,
smiled freshly as the lips of a tender child. Her
arms were bare. In her strong brown hands she
bore a wooden cage, and the waxwing slept
within, its head beneath its wing. She hesitated,
apparently saw no one—listened and heard no
sound. She spurned her flowered frame, and
came springing forward, her short skirt fluttering
above her bare knees, her pink feet gleaming in
the long grasses.</p>

<p>She passed close to me. Noiselessly she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
swept to the steps of the cedar room. She
mounted. I saw her pass through the open doorway,
where there was a pale nimbus of light. I
saw her at the window. She took the magpie’s
cage from its hook, and hung the waxwing there
instead. Soon she reappeared. She carried the
magpie in its cage. She came down the steps,
and I heard a voice like a “moon-drowned” dream
murmur roguishly:</p>

<p>“I have left them the waxwing. But I have
taken away the magpie, lest it tell my secrets.”</p>

<p>I would have stopped her. But she had
sprung with fluttering, perfumed haste through
the syringa frame and vanished.</p>

<p>I dropped to the turf, clasped my arms about
my head, and slept, a deep, refreshing sleep. It
was dawn when I awakened, a pink, sweet-smelling
dawn, scintillant with promise. I went to the
cedar room, Joey slept, one arm thrown out above
his tousled head, the shawl-flower quilt tossed
aside. I covered him, and crossed to the window.</p>

<p>The magpie’s cage swung in its accustomed
place.</p>

<p>As I approached, the bird fixed me with its
quick, bright eye, and chortled:</p>

<p>“Mr. David Dale! Fixing man! Mr. David—dear.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>How strange that I should dream of Wanza!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dreary days followed for Joey and me.</p>

<p>As the days began to shorten I rode frequently
to Captain Grif’s in the cool of the evening, taking
Joey on the saddle behind me. And each
night Joey dropped asleep on the small bed
in Wanza’s room while I played a rubber of
chess with the captain. When Father O’Shan
was present a new zest was given our evenings.</p>

<p>One stormy night Father O’Shan, Joey and I
were belated at the cottage, and the father and
I kept our good host up to an unconscionable
hour in the room beneath the eaves, while Joey
slept peacefully on the lower floor. Father
O’Shan was in fine fettle, and his stories were
pungent, his drollery inimitable. As the storm
began I rolled into the captain’s bunk and lay
there in vast contentment. The port hole was
open, framing an oval of purple sky and drifting
cloud rack. My fantasy was so keen that I could
fairly smell the odor of bilge and stale fish and
tar, and hear the tramp of feet on the deck over
my head. When the storm was at its fiercest,
and the little cottage shook and the lightning
flashed through the port hole, it was easy to cheat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
myself into the belief that I was experiencing all
the wild delights of a storm at sea.</p>

<p>The talk had turned on the superstitions of
men who go down to the sea in ships. “Lonely
men are superstitious men,” the father said.
“There is something about aloneness that engenders
visions and superstitions. People who
dwell apart all have their visions.”</p>

<p>“And their madnesses,” I interjected. “People
who live at the edge of things are entitled
to their superstitions. During the first months
of my life on my homestead, before Joey’s advent,
I had one or two narrow squeaks—came within
an ace of insanity, I believe now. I went so far
that like the man in the story I met myself coming
round the corner of the cabin one day. I pulled
up then and went to the city for a month and took
a rather menial position.”</p>

<p>Father O’Shan was looking at me curiously.</p>

<p>“I never heard of that before,” he said. “You
pulled through all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! If it had not been for my dog I
might have gone under the first year. But the
dog was understanding.”</p>

<p>“A dog,” Captain Grif explained carefully,
“is the instinctinest animal there be—and the
faithfulest.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>I caught Father O’Shan’s eyes fixed on me
ruminatingly from time to time during the evening.
Once or twice, meeting my eyes, he favored
me with his rare, heart-warming smile. When I
said good night to him in the village, leaning from
the saddle and shifting Joey’s sleeping figure
somewhat, in order that I might offer him my
hand, he pressed close to my horse’s side and
peered up at me with friendly glance through the
semi-darkness of the dimly lighted street.</p>

<p>“Too bad, Dale—too bad,” he said in his winning
tones.</p>

<p>“Eh? Just what is too bad?” I asked.</p>

<p>He gripped my hand.</p>

<p>“Man, I’m sorry I did not know you in the
darkest days—when the dog was understanding.
I’d have tried to be understanding, too. A pity,
Dale—a pity!”</p>

<p>“Never mind!”</p>

<p>“I shall pass through this world but once, you
know—I don’t want to leave more things undone
than I have to. But the unguessed things—that
lurk quite obscure—they have a way of unearthing
themselves—they hurt, Dale! Why, my boy,
I rode past your cabin when you were putting
the roof on! But I was busy. I did not stop.
Oh, well—I’m glad you had your dog!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>“THANK YOU, MR. FIXING MAN”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE bathing and dressing of Joey on Sunday
morning, with Sunday school in
prospect, had always been an indeterminate
process, a sort of blind bargain. But with
each week that was added to his age it became
not only precarious, but downright fagging, and
nerve racking to a degree. When he was a wee
urchin and could go into the wash tub in the
kitchen for his weekly scouring, the process was
comparatively simple, but now that his long legs
precluded that possibility, a liberal soaping and
sponge bath beside the tub was the alternative,
and I found the operation decidedly ticklish.</p>

<p>He knew the minutiæ of the bath so well that
if I neglected the least detail, or varied the prescribed
form, I was called to severe account.</p>

<p>On the Sunday morning following our late
evening at Captain Grif’s we arose late, and consequently
there was a scramble to get our breakfast
over and the water heated for the bath. But in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
due time all the preliminaries were adjusted and
Joey, stripped to the waist, knelt down beside the
tub according to our usual custom, that I might
first give his hair a thorough washing.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t rub soap on it,” he demurred,
as I turned to the soap dish. “Bell Brandon says
so. She says that’s what makes my hair so brash
and funny.”</p>

<p>“Brash, Joey?”</p>

<p>“That’s what she said.”</p>

<p>My jaw dropped. “How shall we get it clean,
boy?”</p>

<p>“You make a lather. Shave off little chunks
of soap and put ’em in a bottle and shake ’em up
with water.”</p>

<p>These directions were followed, and both Joey
and I were gratified with the result, but precious
moments were consumed in the process.</p>

<p>After that Joey got water in his ear, and had to
dance like a Piute, on one leg, and shake his head
until it was dislodged. Next he sat on the side
of the tub and tipped it sufficiently to deluge the
floor with half the contents. This necessitated a
scurry for the mop, and when I rather curtly declined
the lad’s services, tears came to the brown
eyes, his head drooped, and quite a quarter of an
hour was expended in salving his feelings, submitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
to bear hugs and listening to assurances
that he had not meant to spill his bath water.</p>

<p>After that we got down to business, and I stood
Joey in the tub, soaped him well, soused him with
the sponge quickly, and rubbed him with a coarse
towel until his small body was in a glow. As I
was drying his feet, he said gently:</p>

<p>“I guess I’m a little boy yet, ain’t I, Mr.
David? I guess it’s a good thing you know how
to take care of me.”</p>

<p>He rubbed his cheek against my arm.</p>

<p>“Where’s your shirt, boy?”</p>

<p>He pointed.</p>

<p>Oh, such a pitiful, faded, abject blue and
white rag it seemed, hanging on the chair back!
I turned it this way and that, regarding it
dubiously.</p>

<p>“Will it do, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sure it’ll do. My, course it’ll
do.”</p>

<p>I sighed. “We’ll have to get some new ones
when you start to school, boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, but when I wear the tie Bell Brandon
gave me, who sees the shirt,” he said absently.</p>

<p>I looked around at him. He was inspecting a
red, angry looking mark on his chest. “Will that
always be there, Mr. David?” he asked plaintively,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
touching it. “It always has been there.
What makes it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a birth mark, Joey. If ever you should
get stolen, and when I found you a bad man
should say: ‘He’s not your boy,’ I could answer:
‘My boy has a round red mark on his chest.’ See
how fine that would be.”</p>

<p>Joey laughed, and held out his arms for the
shirt.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I was arranging the gaily
striped Windsor tie beneath the turn down collar
of the worn shirt, when the familiar sound of
creaking harness and whirring wheels reached my
ear. Wanza had not paid Cedar Dale a visit
since the day she went away in tearful silence
bearing the waxwing with her.</p>

<p>When I opened the door and saw her radiant
face my spirits lightened suddenly, and a spray of
sunshine seemed to sweeten the dingy kitchen as
she stepped over the threshold.</p>

<p>“Am I in time?” she breathed.</p>

<p>“In time? In time for what, Wanza?” I
asked.</p>

<p>She dropped a bundle on to the table.</p>

<p>“In time for Joey to wear one of these to Sunday
school?” she said, portentously.</p>

<p>Joey crept closer. Her eyes as they turned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
him were blue as summer skies and as shining.
She snapped the string that held the bundle intact.
Joey and I saw an amazing array of small
shirts—checked shirts, striped shirts, white shirts.</p>

<p>“Where—where did they come from, Wanza?”
stammered Joey.</p>

<p>But I had guessed.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s the first real present I’ve ever made
you, Joey. It sure won’t be the last! Hustle
into the cedar room now, and get into the white
one with the frills—the white ones are for Sunday
school.”</p>

<p>I could say nothing. And as for Joey, he
gathered the shirts in his arms and went away to
the cedar room snivelling. Wanza and I were
left to look into each other’s faces questioningly.
“How is it with you, Wanza?” I asked, just as
she put the query, “How do you get along, Mr.
Dale?”</p>

<p>We both laughed, and the awkwardness of the
situation was relieved.</p>

<p>“I miss you terribly, Wanza,” I confessed.
“My sour dough bread turns to dust and ashes in
my mouth.”</p>

<p>Her soft eyes were commiserating. “I’ll fetch
you a good sweet loaf of my baking, now and
then,” she volunteered quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>“And don’t drive by as you have been doing.
Are you too busy to stop as you used to do, girl?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“I’m busy, all right.” She lifted the cover
from a small tin pail on the back of the stove, and
sniffed with the air of a connoisseur at the yeast it
contained. “That needs more sugar!”</p>

<p>“It needs doctoring,” I conceded ruefully. “I
set it last night and it has not risen.”</p>

<p>“Has Joey been having his bath here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She looked about her.</p>

<p>“I’ll straighten around a bit, I believe.
Empty that tub, and open the windows, Mr.
Dale, and I’ll get the broom and give the cabin a
thorough cleaning. And then before I go I’ll
set some yeast for you that’ll raise the cover off
the pail in no time.”</p>

<p>Later as I was holding the dust pan for
Wanza, Joey came from the cedar room fresh
and smiling in the white shirt, the Windsor tie in
his hand. Wanza laid aside her broom, and with
deft fingers fastened the tie into a wonderful bow
beneath the boy’s chin. He kissed us both, and
we went with him to the meadow bars where
Buttons was tethered. I lifted him to the saddle
and stood looking after him with a thrill of pride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
as he rode away. In his new white shirt and
clean corduroy trousers, with his hair carefully
brushed and his adorable brown face aglow and
his big bright eyes radiant with happiness he was
a charming enough picture of boyhood; and a
prick of pleasure so sharp as to be almost pain
ran through me as he jauntily blew me a kiss,
and cried:</p>

<p>“I have my penny for the cradle-roll lady, and
I have not forgot my handkerchief.”</p>

<p>That night I dropped asleep in the Dingle and
again I dreamed of Wanza. She came in her
pink gown and bare feet as she had come before;
but this time she carried loaves of steaming,
sweet-smelling bread in her arms; and she came
straight to my side, saying: “This bread is
sweet and wholesome, you poor, poor fellow.”
It seemed to me that she knelt and fed me portions
of the bread with pitying fingers. And
never had morsel tasted more sweet.</p>

<p>As the days went by, in spite of Wanza’s
promises, the girl came but seldom to Cedar
Dale. And when I met her on the river road
or in the village, she seemed distrait and
strangely shy and awkward, and vastly uncommunicative,
so that I felt forlorn enough; and I
was wholly out of touch with my wonder woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>I applied myself feverishly to my writing.
All day long I labored in my shop, in order to
earn the daily bread for Joey and myself, but
each night I wrote. The novel was almost
finished; and something told me it was good.</p>

<p>The weeks passed, and August was waning.
The foliage was yellowing along the river that
crawled like a golden, sluggish serpent in and
out among the brittle rushes. September was
waiting with lifted paint brush. The beauty of
the dreamy, ripe hours made my senses ache.
The earth seemed to lie in a trembling sleep,
folded in fiery foliage. The hills were plumed
with trees of flame. At night the moon’s face
was warm and red, all day the sun burned copper
colored through a light blue haze.</p>

<p>There was something melting and dreamy in
the days as they slipped past—days when I
found it hard to labor in the shop—the woods
were melodious still with bird voices, and all outdoors
called to me.</p>

<p>I took a week’s vacation and fished hard by the
village, where the stream threads the meadows;
companioned by Father O’Shan, I rode along
the river bank in the sunset and tramped the
illumined fields starred with sumach, and in the
moonlight during that week, I sometimes allowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
myself to drift in my canoe on the river, thinking,
thinking, of Haidee—of the narrow oval of
her face curtained in dark hair streams, of the
shadowy eyes of her, of her sweet warm smile.</p>

<p>And then one day I made up my mind suddenly
to go to her.</p>

<p>At the first glimpse I had of her cabin, standing
a crude, warped, misshapen thing on the
slight rise of ground beneath the cedars, all my
former resolves to give to this habitation some
slight air of comfort and refinement rose up and
confronted me, and I saw myself a weak fellow,
who had nursed his despair and disappointment
and failed in his duty to the woman he loved, and
who in his cowardice had absented himself from
his loved one, when he might have brought her
comfort and neighborly assistance.</p>

<p>On the back of an old envelope with a stub
of a pencil I made a rough sketch of the improvements
I had long since planned, and when
Haidee and Wanza came to the door, I greeted
them calmly and showed them the sketch.
Haidee stood there, without her crutches, her hair
unbound about her ivory face. Her gown was
white, and a scarf of rose color swung from her
shoulders. She looked at me for a long moment
with eyes dull and faded as morning stars, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
then gradually the old familiar light came back
into her face, her eyes warmed and grew human.
She stepped outside, and joined me on the porch.</p>

<p>“You have laid aside your crutches?” I
ventured.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are well?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I work—hard—at various things.
Do I not, Wanza? I sleep. I have a splendid
appetite. And you?”</p>

<p>“I work. I sleep well, too. I drop asleep in
the Dingle occasionally after a hard day’s work.
The Dingle is Wanza’s retreat—she walks there.
Do you know it, Wanza?”</p>

<p>She came to my side quickly. Her face displayed
signs of perturbation. “I walk there!
What do you mean? Have you seen me?”</p>

<p>“You come on tip-toe. It is hardly walking.”</p>

<p>Her eyes questioned me.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen you only a few times. But I suspect
you come frequently.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t, Mr. David Dale.”</p>

<p>She came closer, her cheeks like crimson roses,
her bright eyes angry, her lips scornful.</p>

<p>“You come to visit Joey, I think. You came
the first night after your departure from Cedar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Dale. And you went into the cedar room.” I
smiled into her troubled face.</p>

<p>“And what did I do there?”</p>

<p>“You took the magpie’s cage from its hook.
You carried it away with you. But you were
like a little trade rat—you left the cedar waxwing
for Joey and me.”</p>

<p>But just here Wanza flung me an odd look
and ran into the house, saying over her shoulder:
“That was a funny, funny dream.”</p>

<p>Haidee favored me with a rather intent look,
and dropped her gaze to the envelope in her hand.
We walked around the cabin, and I explained
how I planned to build a small rustic pergola with
a trellis for wild honeysuckle at the back door to
serve as a breakfast room next summer, and timidly
at last, I told her that I wished that I might
cover the rough walls of her sleeping room with
cedar strips and build a pergola outside the door
like the one I had built at Cedar Dale for Joey.</p>

<p>“We’ll plant some woodbine roots this fall, and
set out a crimson rambler. We may as well have
the place blooming like an Eden,” I said.</p>

<p>“And the wilderness shall blossom like the
rose,” murmured Haidee. “Thank you, Mr. Fixing
Man.”</p>

<p>I rode home happier than I had been in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
a long day. When I told Joey of the proposed
improvements at Hidden Lake he shouted with
glee, and a few moments later I heard him tooting
on his neglected flute that had lain strangely mute
since the day when Haidee had sung “Bell Brandon”
to its accompaniment, and we had seen the
smile die from her curling lips and the light of
joy go out in her sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>After this my days were trances. Through
the glowing flame-like hours I worked to transform
the sordid little cabin into a fitting habitation
for my wonder woman. Together we
planned the rustic porch at the rear of the kitchen,
and when the foundation was laid I dug up wild
honeysuckle roots and we planted them with a
lavish hand, bending shoulder to shoulder above
the sweet, moist earth, our hands meeting, Haidee’s
breath on my face, her unsteady laughter in
my ear, the charm of her rare, compelling personality
stirring my senses to ecstasy.</p>

<p>I labored each day till the sun was well down
behind Nigger Head; and then came a half hour
of blissful idleness on the front porch with
Haidee behind a tea tray facing me, Wanza handing
around cheese cakes and sandwiches, and
master Joey sitting on a three-legged stool, the
picture of smug, well-fed complacency.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>Wanza’s conduct puzzled me sorely during
these days. At times she jested with me in her
old bright rollicking way, but oftener her mood
was fitful, and she was hot-tempered, difficult and
distrait.</p>

<p>One evening I rode to the village with her in
her cart on a special errand for Haidee. It was
a mellow, moonlight evening. The air was ripe
with a frosted sweetness, a tang that only autumn
evenings hold. I was in boisterous spirits; and
as Wanza drove I relapsed into my old way of
alternately bantering and teasing and flattering
my companion.</p>

<p>“When you no longer line your umbrella with
pink, Wanza,” I said, “I will know that vanity
and you have parted company.”</p>

<p>The blonde head turned restlessly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t half as vain as I used to be.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s bad, Wanza—very bad! A pretty
girl is naturally vain. And as for the pink lining—it’s
as natural for a fair, pale girl like you to
line her umbrella with pink as it is for a fruit
dealer to stretch pink gauze over his sallow fruit.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” Wanza demanded
fiercely. She dropped the lines. “Now,
what do you mean by that, I say?”</p>

<p>“Dear Wanza,” I said, soothingly, “I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
mean anything—except that pink lends a pretty
glow to an alabaster skin like yours.”</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed at me savagely in the moonlight,
and she made a strange sound in her throat
that sounded like a sob.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” I continued, “why
you’re so sensitive, of late. Why, it’s so hard to
talk to you! You’re so difficult I feel like
putting on a mental dress-suit and kid gloves
when I converse with you. What’s come over
you, Wanza?”</p>

<p>“Nothing’s come over me. It’s you,” she answered
in a low tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” I responded, “Wanza girl, I treat
you just the same as I ever did, my dear!”</p>

<p>“But you don’t treat me the same as you do
her—you don’t treat me just the same—” her
voice sounded husky. She turned her head
away.</p>

<p>What could I reply?</p>

<p>I ventured finally: “I don’t know exactly
what you mean, child! But I hope I show by my
manner to you how very much you count in my
life,—how dear you are to Joey and me—how
fine and staunch a friend we have ever found
you—I hope I show this, Wanza. If I do not
I am sorry indeed.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>There was a slight movement towards me
on the girl’s part. Her hand crept out shyly
and touched mine. I heard her whisper chokingly:</p>

<p>“If I mean a good deal to you and Joey I
sure ought to be satisfied. It oughtn’t to matter—really
matter—if you smile different when
you speak to her.”</p>

<p>I took her hand. I was moved. Again I
marveled that Wanza had the power to shake me
so. “You have your own place, child,” I said.
And when she questioned, “But what is my place,
Mr. Dale?” I asked myself what indeed was her
place. “I shall tell you some time,” I answered,
which was not at all the remark I desired to
make, and I spoke in palpable confusion.</p>

<p>After a short interval she took her hand from
mine, and gathered up the lines, not looking at
me as she said: “Mr. Batterly is back in Roselake.”</p>

<p>I caught her by the shoulder. I drew her
quickly to me till I could see her face in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“When did he come back?” I asked, thickly.</p>

<p>She tugged at my restraining hand and
shrugged away from me. “He’s been back two
weeks, I calculate—may be more.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>“Don’t speak to him, Wanza—don’t look at
him!” I implored quickly.</p>

<p>She faced me proudly at this. “Do you think
I would,” she cried scornfully, “except to
answer him when he speaks to me on the road?”</p>

<p>“I did not know, Wanza,” I murmured
humbly.</p>

<p>“Did not know! It’s little you know me any
way, David Dale, I am thinking. If you know
me so little as not to know that, why should I
care indeed how you treat me, or what my place
is with you? Why should I care? Sometimes I
think, David Dale, I think that I hate you. I’m
thinking it now. Yes, yes, yes!”</p>

<p>“Please, please, Wanza—”</p>

<p>“Stop! I will ask a few questions, myself. I
will put them to you, although I never—in
loyalty to you—put them to myself. But it is
not for you to tell me how to behave—how to
walk so and so—say and do so and so! This is
the question I will put: Is it right for you to
spend each and every day at Hidden Lake? Is
it? Answer that to yourself—not to me—before
you tell me not even to speak civilly to Mrs.
Batterly’s husband. I don’t want to speak to
him! I don’t want him to speak to me! No,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
nor look at me. Can you say as much for her,
David Dale?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to say,” I stammered,
taken by surprise.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to say nothing—not to me.
I’m not your judge. But answer the questions
to yourself, quick, before you tell me what to
do and what not, again! Go on, Rosebud,
you’re a-getting to be slower and slower!”</p>

<p>I glanced at her face. It was pale, and her
lips were unsteady.</p>

<p>About this time Joey began to take sudden
trips down the river in the flat-bottomed swift-water
boat, poling away industriously each
morning with a fine show of mystery—unconsciously
admonishing me to appear indifferent
and uninterested. I carried my apathy too far,
I imagine, for one day he said to me:</p>

<p>“Mr. David, do you mind the old hollow
stump in the willows on the river bank—where
the flycatcher’s left a funny big nest?”</p>

<p>I answered yes. I had marked it well. The
secret waterway which led to Hidden Lake was
close by.</p>

<p>“Well,” Joey continued, looking very important,
and puffing out his chest like a pouter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
pigeon, “Bell Brandon and me have a post-office
there. She leaves the most things for me there
under the flycatcher’s nest in a box—cut-out
pictures, and cookies, and fludge.”</p>

<p>“Fudge, Joey boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes—fludge. And say, Mr. David—any
time you’re passing, look in, won’t you? ’Cause
there might be something there would spoil.”</p>

<small>BEREFT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;HAD not heard from Janet Jones again
and I was beginning to think that I might
never have another letter from her when a
missive came.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thank you for my cedar chest (she wrote). It
reached me safely, but I have been ill in body and mind
and unable to write sooner. Oh, the joy my bit of
cedar wood is to me. When I look at it, I am transported
at once to the heart of the clean woods. And
I shut my eyes and vision the tree hosts in their tawny
brown, like Khaki-clad soldiers marshalling at the
trumpet call of the rushing September winds. What
a sparkle and spirited flavor there is in the wine-like
air. How the leaves swirl in the paths like gilded cups,
and winnow through the air like painted galleons, and
rustle and unroll beneath the tread, like cloth of gold.
Oh, I love the summer. But the fall with its shining
sumptuous days—its melancholy grandeur surpasses
it. Only—the birds are gone—are they not? And
the dear clever nests—“half-way houses on the road to
Heaven”—sway tenantless. While the wood aisles
seem hushed and solemn, I know, like vast cathedral
spaces after the organ has ceased to reverberate.</p>
</div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>I read this letter with delight, and I wrote and
thanked Janet Jones as cordially as I knew how
for the pleasure it had given me. I began to
look forward to her next missive, and I was beginning
to experience no small satisfaction from
our peculiar, unconventional friendship, when a
strange thing happened.</p>

<p>Joey and I were tearing out the straw from
his mattress one day, intent on our usual fall
house-cleaning, when my fingers closed over a
bit of cardboard. I drew it forth, unrolled it,
and smoothed it in my hand. It was the small
square visiting card that had been attached to the
parcel that Haidee had placed in my saddle-bag
for Joey, on the day that now seemed so long
ago, when I had gone to fell the trees at Hidden
Lake and had ridden so ungallantly away.</p>

<p>Joey sprang at me and seized my wrist.
“That’s mine! That’s mine!” he shouted.
“Give it here, Mr. David—please.”</p>

<p>But I was staring at the writing on the back
of the card. “For the boy who goes to Sunday
school,” Haidee had written in strong, clear characters.
Surely, the hand that had penned that
line had more recently penned other lines to me
and beneath them signed the name of Janet
Jones.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>I had a letter in my pocket, and later I compared
the writing on the envelope with that on
Joey’s card. And I smiled to myself; but
wonderingly. Still a doubt assailed me. I grew
wary. And fate favored me. When Wanza
stopped her cart at the meadow bars en route to
Roselake one day, to pick up Joey, I saddled
Buttons and rode to the village in their wake.
At the post-office I swung out of my saddle.</p>

<p>“Give me your letters, Wanza,” I suggested.
“Don’t get down. I’ll post them.”</p>

<p>Once inside the office I ran the letters through
my fingers. There were two letters addressed to
Miss Janet Jones, Spokane, Washington, and
the writing was that with which I had grown
familiar in Janet Jones’ letters to me.</p>

<p>I was completely mystified. I rode home in a
brown study. And then suddenly I reached a
solution. That night I wrote a letter. I took
great pains with its construction. And after
Joey was in bed I paddled away down the river
in the light of the moon to the hollow stump
among the willows on the bank. I placed my
letter to Haidee within the recess on a soft bed
of ferns and dried grass that I found there; and
then I paddled stealthily home.</p>

<p>I kept an even face when I greeted Haidee the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
following day, and she did not betray by word
or glance that she had received a communication
from me. But as I opened my lunch pail that
night to give Joey some doughnuts that Wanza
had sent him, there on top was a small white
envelope addressed to me.</p>

<p>I read the letter after Joey was in bed and I
had built up a fire of pine cones on the hearth.
It was a characteristic Janet Jones letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dear Mr. Craftsman</i>:</p>

<p>Once upon a time—which is the way I begin my
fairy tales to Joey—there was a certain foolish
woman, whom we will call Haidee, who lived all alone
in the heart of a forest. She was a very headstrong
young woman, full of whims and insane impulses, or
she never would have gone into the forest to live alone.
But she loved Nature passionately and she had suffered
and known heartache—and she felt that Nurse Nature
could assuage pain.</p>

<p>A big-hearted woodsman lived nearby in this same
forest. He swung his ax, and befriended her. He
labored in the hot sun felling trees that the headstrong
woman might be safe in her flimsy shack. But the
woman taunted him, and when he would have felled
every tree that endangered her habitation she stayed
his hand. Then, one day, retribution overtook her.
A tree fell, and she was hewn down in her conceit and
foolhardiness. She was taken to the woodsman’s cabin
by the kind-hearted woodsman who rescued her. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
she was cared for tenderly, and the coals of fire burned
her poor silly head—so much so that, knowing she was
a burden and an expense to the woodsman, who, like
most big-hearted honest woodsmen, was desperately
poor, she lay awake nights planning how best to
recompense him without wounding his proud spirit.
At last, she thought of a plan. And with the connivance
of a dear old-time friend in Spokane, carried it
out. Her friend gave her permission to sign her name
to the letters she wrote the woodsman. After the
letters were written, they were sent to the original
Janet Jones, who forthwith mailed them to the woodsman
at Roselake. Janet Jones also, naturally, received
the letters which the woodsman wrote, and in due
time they were put into envelopes and addressed to the
headstrong woman, whom they did not fail to reach.
The cedar chest was the headstrong woman’s gift to
Janet Jones, who is an invalid, and a romanticist who
enjoys beyond all words any departure from the commonplace.</p>

<p>Am I forgiven, Mr. Fixing Man? And now, one
word more. You will not receive another letter from
Janet Jones. And—I pray you, come not too often to
Hidden Lake—it is better so.</p>
</div>

<p>This was the missive which I read in the firelight.
As I finished I suddenly felt bereft.
And I lay back in my chair and stared into the
coals with unseeing eyes, brooding miserably,
groping in a misty sea of doubt and unrest and
feeble desire. Then Joey called me in his sleep.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
Just as I was sinking utterly, I heard, “Mr.
David, Mr. David,” and the cry of appeal braced
me, strengthened the man in me. I went in to
him as a sinner into a sanctuary, and the kiss he
gave me sleepily was a salve that solaced and
sustained me throughout the trying night.</p>

<p>I had finished the improvements on Haidee’s
cabin at this time; so I gave over going to Hidden
Lake in prompt obedience to the request my
wonder woman had made in her letter. But I
wrote an answer to the letter and placed it in the
old stump. I assured her that I would respect
her wishes, and I begged her to let me know the
instant I could serve her in any way, promising
her that never a day should pass without my
going to the secret post-office.</p>

<p>I had advertised my cedar chests in the magazines
during the summer, and orders began to
pour in, so that I was kept busy in my workshop.
Those were busy days in the house as well, for,
with the beginning of September, Joey had
started to school at Roselake, and many of the
small duties he had taken upon his young
shoulders devolved upon me.</p>

<p>Oh, the day on which Joey started to school!</p>

<p>I dressed him carefully that morning, with all
the trepidation of an over-fond parent, and I admonished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
him concerning his demeanor in the
school-room until I am sure his small head must
have been in a whirl, and his little heart in a
flutter of apprehension.</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best, Mr. David, dear,” he said
bravely. “You said yourself they can’t no one
do more.” He hesitated and looked at me, reddening
painfully. “And if the teacher asks me
who am I—and who’s—who’s my father—what
am I to tell her?”</p>

<p>My hand closed on his shoulder fiercely.
“Tell her you are Mr. Dale’s boy, from Cedar
Dale—tell her your name is Joey Dale,” I cried.
The look on his face had stabbed me.</p>

<p>He considered, looking into my eyes awesomely
as I took his chin in my hand.</p>

<p>“If I have the Dale part, couldn’t I have the
David, too?” he suggested. “Hm! Then we’d
be big David and little David.”</p>

<p>“David Dale, the second,” I said, poking him
in the ribs.</p>

<p>“But there couldn’t be any David Dale, the
second. There couldn’t never be but one real
David Dale. But there could be a little David.”</p>

<p>A little David!</p>

<p>That was a dragging day. I missed the lad
which ever way I turned. And his words to me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
when he leaped to my arms from old Buttons’
back that night! “It was fine! I liked it, really
and truly. But, oh, Mr. David, I ’most knew
you was lonely and missing me!”</p>

<p>Every morning I walked to the edge of the
meadow, let down the bars for old Buttons, and
watched Joey ride away, his sturdy little figure
jouncing up and down in the saddle, his brave,
bright face turned back to me over his shoulder,
with rare affection beaming from big big brown
eyes, as he waved and waved to me until a bend
of the road hid him from my sight.</p>

<p>One memorable morning in the latter part of
September, as I was tightening the saddle girths,
he bent down to me, and as I lifted my head he
surprised me with a quick shame-faced salute of
moist lips on my forehead.</p>

<p>“You’re a good Mr. David,” he said patronizingly.
“And I ain’t yours either—not blood
kin.”</p>

<p>I hugged the little lad to me—a sudden fierce
warmth of affection stirring my sluggish halting
heart that had grown weary lately of life’s complexities.</p>

<p>“You’re my boy, just the same,” I assured
him.</p>

<p>“They can’t anybody get me away from you—can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
they?” he asked anxiously, and I saw genuine
consternation in his eyes.</p>

<p>I laughed and hugged him tighter. “I guess
not,” I bragged. “Let them try. Jingles would
eat them up.”</p>

<p>“And we’d hide, wouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>“We surely would.”</p>

<p>“And—and we’d shoot at them from the
rushes.”</p>

<p>I know not why Joey’s words should have irked
me, but the day seemed long, and I was glad when
I heard the soft thud of Buttons’ hoofs on the
turf outside the cabin promptly at the accustomed
hour. I was building the kitchen fire, but I
straightened up, stepped to the door, and threw it
wide.</p>

<p>Buttons stood with his bridle over his head, his
nose sniffing the ground, but no Joey sprang
from the saddle into my eager arms. The horse
was riderless.</p>

<p>All Roselake joined in the search for Joey,
after I had ascertained that the lad was not with
Haidee, and the search was prolonged far into
the night. The school-master had seen Joey ride
away at the close of school, and I argued that
Buttons must have come straight home. At
dawn the search was resumed. For miles in each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
direction the searching party spread out, but at
night, totally disheartened, the kindly neighbors
disbanded, and Joey’s case was left in the hands
of the police.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>“PERHAPS I SHALL GO AWAY”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALONE the next day I took up the search
for Joey, beating back and forth between
Roselake and Cedar Dale, and
penetrating to Wallace and Wardner. It was to
Wanza that I spoke my conviction at last, sitting
my cayuse on the river road, while she sat stiff
and tearful-eyed in her cart, pale even beneath
the pink-lined umbrella.</p>

<p>“It looks to me, Wanza girl,” I said wearily,
“like a plain case of kidnapping.”</p>

<p>“But who would kidnap him, Mr. Dale?”
Wanza queried pitifully.</p>

<p>“Why—that’s the question,” I returned.
“Have you ever seen him talking to any one—any
stranger—when you have met him going and
returning from school?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “Once,” she replied,
“Joey was with me, and Mr. Batterly stopped us.
He asked me all about Joey—seeming so keen!
And I told him—thinking it no harm—just how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
a dying woman gave him to you, saying he was a
waif that had been picked up after a storm over
on the Sound by her dead brother, who had been
a fisherman.”</p>

<p>“Where is Batterly now,” I asked.</p>

<p>“Gone away—this week past.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” I sighed, “we’ll acquit him. I’m
sure he was not over fond of Joey.” After a
pause I asked brusquely: “Where has he gone?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know—sure I don’t, Mr. Dale. The
last I heard of him he was going to hire a swift-water
boat and a poler, and try the swift-water
fishing above St. Joe.”</p>

<p>“Then he hasn’t left the country,” I said.
And my heart sank leaden and my hate of the
man boiled up in my veins fiercely, as I pictured
him still skulking about, a menace to Haidee’s
peace of mind.</p>

<p>The time went very heavily past. All my days
and many nights were spent in the saddle, and
the evenings that I passed at Cedar Dale were
consumed in feverish plans for the scoutings that
I made. I did not even now attempt to visit
Haidee at Hidden Lake; but one morning, at
sunrise, hearing a soft tap on my door, I opened
to see Wanza standing there with a covered
basket on her arm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“I saw your light last night,” she quavered.
“I have brought you some good nourishing food.
I can see you’re not cooking for yourself.
You’re growing white and thin.”</p>

<p>Her womanly act in coming thus to offer
me comfort stirred me strangely, appealed to
the finest fibre in my nature. Her simplicity,
her self-forgetfulness made me falter at her
feet.</p>

<p>But at last I gave over my scoutings. I made
a cedar chest for Joey’s room, and in this I placed
all his little kickshaws, his few clothes, and his
flute, along with the gay Indian blanket he had
reveled in, and the quilt Wanza had pieced for
him. The room thus became to me a sort of
shrine. And finding me here at the close of a
long day with tears of which I was not ashamed
in my eyes, Wanza broke down and sobbed beside
me.</p>

<p>“I’d like to kill whoever it is as has taken
Joey away,” she cried, brandishing a resentful
fist.</p>

<p>“If we knew any one had taken him,” I said,
thoughtfully. “Sometimes I think—I think,
Wanza, that Joey is dead.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so! No, indeed!” Wanza returned
with thrilling earnestness. “Oh, I feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
sure he ain’t dead! He’ll be found—some day.
He sure will, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>She helped me by her sturdy optimism.</p>

<p>Soon after this Wanza and I fell into the habit
of tramping through the gleaming golden woods
together almost daily, breathing the crisp sweet
autumn air. Wanza in her bright sweater, with
her tawny hair, and the carmine in her cheek
flitted in and out of the wood paths like a forest
dryad, exclaiming at every frost-touched leaf, and
reveling in the painted glory about us.</p>

<p>“But the birds are gone,” she said, a tear in her
tones, as we looked into an empty king-bird’s nest
one day. “I love the king-birds—they’re sleek
dandies—that’s what they are! Oh, Mr. Dale,
what a heartache an empty nest gives me! The
dear little birds are gone—”</p>

<p>“And Joey is not here,” I ended sadly.</p>

<p>After awhile I went on: “Yes, summer has
gone. It is the most evanescent time of the year.
It slips and slips away—and just as you grasp it
and thrill to its sweetness it melts into—this—as
happiness merges into sorrow.”</p>

<p>Her face quivered, and her eyes came to
mine. “I guess that is so,” she said in a low
tone.</p>

<p>Looking in Wanza’s face lately I always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
turned away. I did so now. The look of questioning
I found there—the mute appeal—the
suffering—these unmanned me. But it grew to
be a strange satisfaction to be with her, through
long crisp daylight hours, in the hush of pink
sunsets, in the gilded autumn twilights, while we
rested after a meagre supper cooked over a camp
fire, chatting desultorily, and watching the big
pale stars came out to lie like white-tipped marguerites
on the purple bosom of the sky above
our heads.</p>

<p>One day I spoke my thought.</p>

<p>“I am thinking, Wanza—perhaps I shall go
away.”</p>

<p>We were in the heart of the woods. A
tinkling, sly little brook made the forest musical,
the rustle and purr of the pines sounded about us
like fluty organ notes. Wanza’s eyes were lifted
to the sprightly shivering leaves of a cottonwood,
and her face was very still. She did not move as
I spoke, and I repeated my sentence.</p>

<p>“I thought you’d go,” she said. She spoke
harshly.</p>

<p>“I can’t stop on here without Joey. I can’t
bear it,” I said, haltingly.</p>

<p>“But I’ve got to stay on without either of you—and
bear it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>I saw her eyes. I recoiled at the depth of pain
revealed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dale,” she said gropingly, after a pause,
“where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Wanza. But inaction is intolerable.
I must be doing something. I must
get away for awhile, at least. It is better.”</p>

<p>Wanza’s eyes were very bright. Her hands
that were smoothing a maple leaf were trembling.
Her voice sounded dry and hard as she asked:</p>

<p>“When do you reckon you’ll go?”</p>

<p>“Why, child, I do not know! Each day I say
to myself I cannot bear another.”</p>

<p>“It’ll be the same wherever you are.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, Wanza,” I sighed. And then because
I knew the tears were on her cheeks, I
sprang to my feet, saying: “This may be our
last day in the woods together, who knows?
Come, let us try to forget—let us make the best
of what we have.”</p>

<p>Wanza rose. She came close to me. When
our eyes met she gave a cry: “If you go you
may never come back!”</p>

<p>“Never fear. I have no home but Cedar
Dale,” I replied, and I am afraid my voice was
bitter. And when she put her hand on my arm
I shook it off and would have strode away, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
again as in the woods on the occasion of our
gipsying I saw her face close to my own, and
caught my breath in marvel. No, there was
never such a girl-face! Such an elf-face! I
stooped suddenly and framed the face with my
hands. What were her wonderful eyes saying,
back of all the tears, all the mystery? Why—when
I was in love with Haidee—did they draw
me like a lodestar? Why now and then did she
stir me in this strange fashion till I gazed and
gazed, and needs must curb my will to keep from
taking her in my arms and crushing her against
my heart?</p>

<p>I had never faced the question. I did not care
to face it now. I put it away for some future
time, feeling vaguely that it remained to be
reckoned with.</p>

<p>“I have no home but Cedar Dale,” I repeated.</p>

<p>“And I am glad of that,” she whispered.</p>

<p>She pressed nearer to me, and I released her
face, and drew her slowly within the circle of my
arms. But when I held her so, when the floating
hair meshes were just beneath my chin, and her
face brushed my sleeve, I steadied myself.</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I said, “I am almost glad, too, that
I have no other home. When I think of the good
friends I have here—you and your father and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
Father O’Shan—I realize that I am ungrateful
to despise my humble place among you. Keep it
for me, little girl, and I shall come back. Yes,
I shall come back better equipped for the future
among you. If it must be without Joey—” I
hesitated and bit my lip—“without Joey,” I continued
more firmly, “I shall at least try to earn
your respect by holding up my head, and forging
on to some goal. I shall attain to something at
last, I hope. And I hope I shall be able to serve
my neighbors in many ways, and make myself
needed in the community.”</p>

<p>I held her for a moment after saying this, and
then I bent down and for the first time in my
life kissed her. But it was on the brow that I
kissed her. And I am sure no brother could have
saluted her more respectfully.</p>

<p>She drew back. Her head fell against my
shoulder. I saw deep into her splendid eyes,—deep,
deep. Back of all the tears and the smiles
and the mystery I read at last what they were
saying. I read—and I was humbled and
abashed. I knew the truth at last. Wanza
loved me.</p>

<p>I saw clearly now, indeed. I recalled Father
O’Shan’s words: “Be careful in your dealings
with that child.” I had been blind, and a fool.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
I blamed myself, and I hated myself. I stood
stupidly staring into the face so near my own
until with a sudden wrench Wanza jerked away
from me, and ran on down the purpling wood-aisle
before me, dashing the tears from her eyes
as she fled.</p>

<p>I walked home slowly, astounded and perplexed
by the revelation I had had.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>FATE’S FINAL JAVELIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night in my lonely cabin I fell ill,
and burned with fever, and shook with
ague so that I was unable to drag myself
about the cabin, but lay all the next day and the
next in my bunk. The following day my fever
left me magically; and late in the afternoon I
arose, fed and curried my half-starved cayuse
and, mounting, rode away beneath the berry-reddened
yews to the trail that led to Haidee.</p>

<p>I dismounted at the rustic pergola at the rear
of the cabin, tethered my cayuse and walked
around to the front door. The door was closed,
and a silence that was almost oppressive brooded
over the place. I ran up the steps, and a curious
premonition that Haidee had gone away sickened
me as I rapped on the panel. Terrified at receiving
no response, I turned the handle, pressed
forward, and caught at the casement for support
in my weakness. I peered in, and at the
sight I saw my knees all but gave way so that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
swung about like a loose sail in a sudden breeze.</p>

<p>On the floor lay Randall Batterly in a ghastly
pool of blood. His face was upturned to the cold
October sunlight. His lips were opened in a
half snarl, his full lids were wide apart over his
rolled back, terrible eyes. He was bleeding from
a wound in his chest. And Haidee stood above
him, gazing down upon him, gray horror painted
on her face.</p>

<p>She heard my step and turned, and I caught
the metallic thud as the revolver she had been
holding dropped to the bare floor. She stared at
me, put out her hand as if to thrust me back. I
saw fear in her face.</p>

<p>“It is you! It is you!” she breathed.</p>

<p>She continued to stare at me with big gaunt
eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, trying to keep the horror out
of my tones. “It is I.”</p>

<p>She shuddered and collapsed to her knees,
clinging to the door frame as a drowning man
clutches and grips a bulwark. The pupils of her
eyes were dilated with terror and despair until
the purple iris was eclipsed, and they stared black
and empty as burnt-out worlds.</p>

<p>“He is dead—dead,” she whispered. “He
can’t speak, or move.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>I picked up the revolver and laid it on the table,
and then I crossed to the rigid form on the floor.
I knelt and pressed my ear to his heart. I lifted
his hand; it fell back inertly. Yes, it was true.
Randall Batterly was gone past recall, facing the
great tribunal above, with who knew what black
secret in his heart.</p>

<p>“We must get a physician,” I murmured
dully.</p>

<p>Haidee crept to my side. Her poor face was
blanched and twisted till she looked like a half-dead
thing.</p>

<p>“Who could have done this—” I stammered, in
a voice that sounded driveling and uncertain in
my own ears.</p>

<p>Again that dumb look of distress in her eyes,
and she stood as if carved in granite.</p>

<p>“My dear—my dear, you must come away—this
is too much for you,” I continued hoarsely.
I took her poor cold hands in mine. And then I
turned and faced the door with a curious certainty
that some one was looking at me, and I saw old
Lundquist’s rat eyes peering in on us from the
doorway.</p>

<p>He said not one word—only stared and stared
at the dead man on the floor, and at the abject
living creatures standing over him; and then he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
crept away like a sliding shadow, and the sunlight
brightened the place again. But in that grim
room Haidee had fallen face downward, stark
and stiff, and her wild scream as she sank echoed
and re-echoed in my ears for days.</p>

<p>I brought water, I bathed her face, I chafed
her hands; but the moments passed and she did
not revive, and twilight fell, as alone, in the
presence of death I wrestled with the stupor that
held her. And there they found me—the sheriff
and old Lundquist.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, lend a hand here,” I cried
imploringly. And then I stood up. “Gentlemen,”
I said, “this—dead man is Mrs. Batterly’s
husband. I believe this to be a suicide—I found
him lying just as you see him a short while ago.
Mrs. Batterly had just discovered him, I believe.
She is—as you see—in no condition to be questioned.”</p>

<p>The sheriff hesitated. I had known the man
for years, and I saw a swift scepticism darken his
keen eyes as they searched my face. He glanced
at Haidee and then at the revolver lying on the
table. He reached over, picked up the weapon
and examined it.</p>

<p>“This revolver is loaded in only four of its
chambers. The fifth has a discharged cartridge.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
Was this lying on the table when you came in,
Dale?”</p>

<p>I spoke hoarsely. “I put it there. It had
fallen to the floor.”</p>

<p>Old Lundquist crawled closer. “That ban
Mrs. Batterly’s revolver,” he mumbled, “I see her
have it—it ban on the table most o’ the time.
Thar be a letter on it—to mark it like.”</p>

<p>The sheriff’s finger traced the outline of the
shining letter on the polished surface of the
weapon. He stood irresolutely, ruminating.</p>

<p>“Come!” I ordered brusquely. “This lady
must be seen to.” And as neither man made a
move to assist me, I lifted Haidee in my arms.
I felt her stir. Her eyes opened suddenly. She
looked at old Lundquist and the sheriff, then up
at me affrightedly. Her hand clutched my arm.
She cowered, and a tremor shook her from head
to foot.</p>

<p>“These men—why are they here?” she asked
faintly.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen—” I was beginning, when the
sheriff stopped me.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Batterly,” he said, clearing his throat,
and speaking raspingly, “this is your revolver?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes—” Haidee drew in her breath
sharply—“why, yes,” she admitted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>I felt her hand tighten its hold on my arm.</p>

<p>“It is mine, surely,” she continued, as no one
spoke. She looked from one to the other appealingly.
“I am fond of shooting at a mark. I
used it only this noon. I left it on the table after
lunch when I went into the woods to sketch. I
heard a shot fired soon after I left—but I thought
nothing of it—rabbit hunters pass the cabin daily.
When I came back to the cabin after a time I—I
found my—husband on the floor, as you see
him—” She halted, something in the eyes she
saw fixed upon her caused her face to whiten.
“Why,” she stammered—“why—you don’t think—think
I—”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Batterly,” the sheriff broke in quickly,
“I arrest you for the murder of your husband,
Randall Batterly.”</p>

<p>I shall never forget the groping look she turned
on me; the dumb appeal that struck to the center
of my heart and set it quivering—the question in
the big deep eyes, clear and pure as a rillet in the
sun.</p>

<p>I don’t know how I gave her into the sheriff’s
custody. I recall that my fists were doubled and
that I mouthed useless imprecations, and that old
Lundquist strove to reason with me, his lank arms
wrapped about me restrainingly, as the sheriff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
bore Haidee away in his gig. I recall climbing
into my saddle and riding away, the echo of
Haidee’s parting injunction in my ears: “Find
Wanza for me, please. She may be able to help
me.”</p>

<p>And I recall that old Lundquist stood shaking
his fist after me in the pergola.</p>

<p>Little I cared for old Lundquist or the pummeling
I gave him. I dug my heels into Buttons’
sides. His hoofs fell with soft thuds on the fallen
leaves that, imbedded in the damp soil, made a
brown mosaic of my path. The bracing air was
in my face, but I rode limp and flaccid, with cold
beads of sweat upon my brow. “Oh, God,” I
groaned, “Oh, God! Oh, God!” But I could
not pray. I only raised my eyes. Overhead the
afterglow shot the sky with rose and silver, and
an apricot moon was rising over the mountains
hooded in white mist. I kept my eyes lifted as I
rode on through the soft dusk to Roselake in quest
of Wanza.</p>

<p>But Wanza was not at her father’s house.
When questioned Captain Grif said she had not
been home since noon. He had supposed she
was with Mrs. Batterly at Hidden Lake. I left
a note for the girl to be given her as soon as she
came in, saying nothing to old Grif of the tragedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
at Hidden Lake, and then, thoroughly disheartened,
I took the road for Cedar Dale.</p>

<p>I made short work of reaching home. I put
Buttons into a gallop, and rode like Tam o’
Shanter through the night, whipped on by the
witches of adversity. I reached the meadow. I
rode through the stubble. The unlighted cabin
seemed to exhale an almost inexorable malevolency
as I came upon it. It greeted me—empty
and pitiless. Even my cupboard was bare.</p>

<p>Toward midnight, unable to breathe the atmosphere
of the cabin, racked with despair, and agog
with restlessness, I stole out, clumsy footed, to the
willows on the river bank. Here I found my
canoe. I slid it into the water, stepped in and
paddled away, seeking surcease from my
thoughts beneath the tent of night.</p>

<p>The friendly current bore me on. Soon I
came opposite the old cottonwood stump, gleaming
white among the shadows. I laid aside my
paddle and drifted along close to the high willow-bordered
banks, the cold, clear stars above me.
The silence and the motion of the canoe were
soporific. I was weak and worn from my recent
illness. My head kept nodding. I closed my
eyes. After a time I slept.</p>

<p>The hoot-hoot of an owl awakened me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
raised my head and looked about me. The darkness
had deepened. The stars had a redder glow
and the mountains stood up like invincible agate
gates against the black sky, shutting in this little
bit of the great world. The night air was cold.
I shivered and jerked my arms mightily to induce
circulation. And then hunger assailed me and
I began to think of food.</p>

<p>I took my paddle and swung my canoe about.
Suddenly, as one remembers a feast when hard
pressed for sustenance, I recalled the doughnuts
and goodies that Haidee had been wont to place
in the hollow stump for Joey. Well, I knew the
cache was empty now.</p>

<p>I reached the stump. I thrust my hand gropingly
within the recess, smiling whimsically at my
fatuous impulse. My fingers encountered a
small object, smooth and heavy to the touch. I
drew it forth. It was a six-chambered revolver,
loaded in five of its chambers. The sixth
chamber contained a discharged cartridge.</p>

<p>A tremor ran over me. Slow horror chilled
my veins. I sickened as my fingers passed over
the cold polished surface, recalling the livid face
of the dead man in the cabin. Mechanically, at
last, I slipped the weapon into my pocket and
took up the paddle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>I slept no more that night. The next morning
with an attorney I visited Haidee in her cell
in the village jail. My poor friend was stricken.
Her pallor was marked, and her great soft eyes
held the pitiful appeal of a hunted deer. She
told the attorney her story straight. A tear
rolled down her cheek, and she faced me with the
question, barely voiced:</p>

<p>“You believe in my innocence?”</p>

<p>And I, shaken and undone, could only cry:
“Believe in you? Oh, my child—do I believe in
myself? I know you are innocent.”</p>

<p>I produced the revolver I had found in the
hollow stump, and the attorney pounced on it
eagerly. “Here is the evidence, indeed,” he said,
thoughtfully. “I think we shall prove that the
bullet that killed Randall Batterly was fired from
this very weapon. Mrs. Batterly’s revolver is of
a different caliber.”</p>

<p>As I left the jail I met Captain Grif. He
plucked at my sleeve. His face worked.
“Wanza ain’t come home yet, Mr. Dale,” he
quavered.</p>

<p>I was startled. “That is strange,” I said.</p>

<p>“She’s always stayed to Hidden Lake nights.
I warn’t surprised when she didn’t s-show up last
night thinkin’ she’d gone peddlin’ in the afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
and then gone on to Hidden Lake about
the time you was askin’ for her, may be. But I
jest heard about Mrs. Batterly bein’ arrested
yesterday.” His voice broke. “For God’s sake,
Mr. Dale, w-where can Wanza be?”</p>

<p>“Where can she be?” I echoed to myself.</p>

<p>Two days passed. Wanza did not return.
To find her became my chief object in life, but all
my inquiries were fruitless. And then on the
third day, Captain Grif came to Cedar Dale.</p>

<p>“I been thinkin’ that Wanza may be with
Sister Veronica at the old Mission near De
Smet,” he quavered, tears standing in his poor
dim eyes.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Father O’Shan?” I asked
quickly.</p>

<p>He shook his head. “Not for days, Mr. Dale,
for God’s sake f-find my gal! F-find her, my
boy, find her! The Mission’s the place to look
for her. Why, when Wanza was a little girl, and
we l-lived at Blue Lake, she used to run to Sister
Veronica with everything, jest l-like a child to
its mother.”</p>

<p>Acting on this information I set out post-haste
that very morning for the old Mission. The
stage had passed an hour before, Buttons had
fallen lame, but I was in a desperate mood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
would brook no delay. The current was with
me, and I slid down the river seven miles and
made a portage to Blue Lake before noon. A
creek flows into Blue Lake, and I followed the
creek to its head. It was well past the noon hour
by then, and I secreted my craft in a tangle of
birches and struck across country on foot. I had
a map in my pocket and a compass, and I went
forward hopefully.</p>

<p>The old Mission stands on an elevation overlooking
a pastoral valley. Gray and solitary it
looms, a gilded cross shining on its blue dome.
But the way to it, unless one follows the main
traveled road, I found to be as hard as the narrow
path that leads to righteousness. Ever and anon
I glimpsed the gilded cross between the pine tops,
but I floundered on through thickets, waded
streams, and beat about in bosky jungles, without
striking the road I sought.</p>

<p>Toward evening when I lifted my eyes, the
shining cross had eluded me. It had comforted
me to have it set like a sign against the sky. But
I kept on doggedly. The thoughts that went
with me were long, hard thoughts. It seemed to
me that through all my unfortunate life I had
been faring on to meet this final javelin of fate—to
have the woman I adored held in the leash of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
the law—to realize my helplessness—to suffer a
thousand deaths a day in my impotency—this was
the denouement prepared for me—awaiting me—when,
as a lad of twenty-four, I had accepted
the stigma of a crime of which I was not guilty
and hidden away as a guilty man may hide!
The only green oasis in the arid waste of my life
had been Joey, and suddenly my heart cried out
for the lad who had been my solace and delight.
I dropped down on a log, and lay supine through
long moments. I thought of Wanza and hoped
and prayed I might find her. Haidee’s face
came before me with its look of pure white courage.
I opened the book of my life still wider
and turned to earlier pages. I grew bitter and
morose. But, gradually, as I lay there, the searing
hurts and perplexities and injustices sank
back into the hush of my soul’s twilight, and I
tore out the blurred pages and treasured only the
white ones on which the names of Joey and
Wanza and Haidee were written. Hope stirred
in my heart.</p>

<p>It was sunset when I roused at last, crawled
to a nearby stream that came slipping along with
endless song, and drank thirstily, and laved my
face. As I knelt, I saw what seemed to be a deserted
cabin, half hidden among scrub pines in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
draw below me. I hailed it, stumbled down the
overgrown trail, and approached it.</p>

<p>The door was closed, the solitary window
boarded over. I tried the door, found it fast,
and rattled it tentatively. A voice cried:
“Who is there?”</p>

<p>My heart gave a violent leap.</p>

<p>I pressed against the door, and swallowed hard
before I could control my tones.</p>

<p>“It is a—a man who is in need of food and
shelter,” I answered.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. David! Mr. David!” the voice
shrieked. And such a lusty shout arose that the
rafters of the old shack fairly trembled.</p>

<p>As for me I leaned in dazed suspense against
the door, impatiently waiting for my lad to open
to me.</p>

<p>“Mr. David—dear, dear Mr. David—I can’t
open the door! He’s taken the key.” I heard
then.</p>

<p>“Who has taken the key, Joey?”</p>

<p>“The big man. He locked me in. Mr. David—can’t
you get me out?”</p>

<p>I placed my shoulder against the door. With
all my strength I gave heave after heave until
the rotten old boards gave way. They splintered
into fragments, and through the jagged opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
crept Joey, my lad—to throw himself into my
arms and cling and cling about my neck, biting
his lips to keep the tears from falling. But my
tears wet the boyish head I pressed against my
breast. I sank to my knees and gathered him
into my arms, and rocked back and forth, crooning
over him, womanishly:</p>

<p>“Joey—Joey! Little lad—dear little lad!”</p>

<p>Soon after I lay in the bunk in the interior of
the one-room shack and Joey cooked a substantial
meal for me; and when it was ready, I ate ravenously
while he hung over me, his hand stealing up
to close about my hand from time to time.</p>

<p>When I had finished I dropped back into the
bunk. “Now then, lad,” I said.</p>

<p>And Joey began his tale by asking: “Mr.
David, am I the big man’s boy?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Joey?”</p>

<p>“He says I’m his boy. He says I was lost in
a shipwreck—when I was a teenty baby.”</p>

<p>I covered my face with my hand. “Go on,” I
bade him, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“One day he saw the mark on my chest. I’d
been fightin’ at school, Mr. David—and coming
home I was crying and sorry, and Wanza, she
came along, in her cart, and she washed my face
and neck and tidied me. The big man came up—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
said: ‘Good day, young man?’ And
when he saw the funny red mark on my chest he
asked Wanza, ‘Who is this boy?’ And Wanza,
she told him how you took me just a three year
old when a woman a few miles down river died,
and how the woman got me over on the Sound of
her brother who was a fisherman and had picked
me up on the beach one time after a storm. The
big man kept asking questions and questions, and
Wanza told him the woman’s brother was dead,
too. And, at last, Wanza got tired of talking
and she just said: ‘Good day, Mr. Batterly,’ and
told me to get in the cart, and we drove off.”</p>

<p>Joey paused and his soft eyes flashed. I was
too greatly overcome to make any comment, and
I lay back, feeling that my world was crashing
in chaos about my head. After awhile the lad
continued:</p>

<p>“That day when he—he stole me, Mr. David,
I was coming home from school along the river
road. He stopped me and he said he was my
father and I must go with him. ‘Get off your
horse,’ he said. I got off Buttons, but I said:
‘No, I’ll not go with you. I’ll ask Mr. David,
first!’ The big man laughed and said you’d find
out soon enough. I kicked and kicked, Mr.
David, when he grabbed me by the arm. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
then another big man came out of the bushes, and
they tied up my mouth and they carried me to a
boat and locked me up in a funny little cupboard.
By and by I went to sleep. Then one
morning I woke up and I was here. I heard the
big man say to the other man: ‘I’ve got him,
Bill. My wife’ll have to come to terms now.’”</p>

<p>Again Joey paused, and I writhed and was
silent. Joey looked at me commiseratingly and
went on:</p>

<p>“’Most a week ago he told me he was going to
fetch Bell Brandon. ‘You be a good boy,’ he
said, ‘and I’ll bring her.’ And he went away;
but he locked the door, ’cause he said he couldn’t
trust me. I ’most knew you’d come, Mr. David!
The minute you knocked I knew you’d come for
me. And I’m going away with you—and you’ll
punish the big man, won’t you? And I’m not his
boy, am I, Mr. David?”</p>

<p>“If you are his boy,” I said huskily, “you belong
to Bell Brandon, too.” And with my words
a terrible blinding despair swept over me. I was
too steeped in lassitude and despondency to
reason, too greatly fatigued to wonder. I closed
my eyes and turned my face to the wall.</p>

<p>After awhile a blanket was drawn carefully
over me. I felt a warm breath on my face. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
eyes opened straight into Joey’s, and I reached
out and took his hand in mine. “Joey,” I
whispered, seeing shining drops on his cheeks,
“Joey, I’m in trouble. I must think, lad! The
big man won’t be back, lad—he’ll not return at
all—I know that—you will never see him again.
But after awhile you and Bell Brandon will be
very happy together—after awhile.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. David? Ain’t I
going to live at Cedar Dale again, with you, and
Jingles and Buttons, same as ever? Oh, ain’t I,
Mr. David?” my little lad cried out, and his tears
fell fast.</p>

<p>I slept that night with Joey at my side in the
narrow bunk, and I awoke at intervals, and stared
out through the glimmering casement at the
moon-silvered trees. Weary as I was, my cogitations
kept me from repose. I promised myself
that I would push on to the Mission in the morning.
Joey should go with me, and the stage
should bear us back to Roselake, although this
would necessitate a delay. I moved, and Joey’s
hand fluttered out toward me in his sleep. He
whispered my name.</p>

<p>I slept again, waking to see the curtain at the
window I had opened, pushed aside, and a face
peering in at me in the cold gray light of morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
It was withdrawn and a hand fell on the door. I
looked down at Joey’s tousled head pillowed on
my arm. Laying him gently down on the pillow,
I arose and took my revolver from my pocket.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I demanded, throwing
open the door.</p>

<p>The man standing there put out his hand
quickly. It was Father O’Shan.</p>

<p>“You have come from the Mission?” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can you give me news of Wanza, then? Is
she at the Mission?”</p>

<p>He took the revolver from my grasp, looked
at me curiously, and placed his hand on my
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, when I passed here, I thought I
heard a child sobbing. I was too greatly overwrought
at the time to attach importance to it.
In the night I recalled the boarded over window
and I could not rest. I came to investigate.”</p>

<p>He hesitated. I waited, and he came a step
closer.</p>

<p>“David Dale,” he said, with evident reluctance,
“Wanza Lyttle has confessed to being implicated
in the murder of Randall Batterly. I took her
to Roselake myself yesterday. She has given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
herself up. Mrs. Batterly was set at liberty a
few hours later.”</p>

<p>I reeled, and sat down weakly on the steps.
“Not Wanza! Not Wanza!” I kept repeating
over and over.</p>

<p>Something gripped me by the throat, tears in
my eyes smarted them. I clasped my head with
my arms, hiding my face. I felt drowning in
deep currents. That brave girl—insouciant,
cheery, helpful Wanza! What had she to do
with the murder of Randall Batterly?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>RENUNCIATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">JOEY and I slept that night at Cedar Dale,
and the next morning as early as might be
I obtained permission to visit Wanza in
the village jail. We looked into each other’s eyes
for a beating moment, and then I had her hands
in mine and was whispering, “Courage, courage,
Wanza.”</p>

<p>The color surged into her white cheeks, and her
eyes blazed.</p>

<p>“Do you think I did it, David Dale?” she whispered
painfully.</p>

<p>“Wanza—child—what sort of confession have
you made?”</p>

<p>“I told them I was the only one who knew anything
about it. I told them it was a shot from my
revolver that killed Mr. Batterly. They showed
me the revolver Mrs. Batterly’s attorney had,
that you found in the hollow stump, and I swore
it was mine. And so they put me in here to wait
for a trial. But they let her go. It was on her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
account that I told what I did. I never said I
killed him—never!”</p>

<p>“My poor, poor, girl!”</p>

<p>“Hush! Please don’t! Don’t say a word!
Oh, I don’t want to break down—I been through
a lot—a lot! I’ll tell you all now—all, Mr. Dale!
It was like this. That day at Hidden Lake Randall
Batterly found me there alone. He was
drunk—very drunk. I had just come in and I
thought Mrs. Batterly had gone to Roselake as
she had intended. I told him so when he asked
for her. And—when he thought there was no
one about he began saying all sorts of silly things.
Truly, Mr. Dale, I had never spoken to him but
just three times in the village—just to be civil.
But he said some downright disgusting things
that day, and he put his arms around me, and he
held me tight, and he—he kissed me twice—oh, so
fierce like! though I struck him hard. I got
frightened. I saw he was so drunk he could
scarcely stand. Mrs. Batterly’s revolver was lying
on the table. I motioned to it. ‘Don’t touch
me again, Mr. Batterly,’ I screamed, ‘or I’ll shoot
myself.’ I think I was almost out of my head
with fright. I turned to run from the room when
he caught my arm. I had my own revolver in the
pocket of my sweater coat, and I pulled it out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
quick as a flash. ‘Come,’ he said, looking ugly,
‘give me that revolver! Give it here! Don’t be
a fool.’ We had a scuffle and he had just
wrenched the revolver away from me, when, oh,
Mr. Dale, it slipped from his hands and struck the
floor hard, and went off. He had been grinning
at me because he had got the revolver in his own
hands, and he stood there still grinning for a second—oh,
an awful second—and then he just
crumpled up and dropped on the floor at my feet,
dead, dead, dead!”</p>

<p>It was impossible for Wanza to go on for a moment
or two. And when she continued, at length,
after a paroxysm of sobbing, my arm was around
her, and her poor drooping head was against my
shoulder.</p>

<p>“When I saw that he was dead, Mr. Dale, I
picked up my revolver, and I ran as fast as I
could out of the cabin and hid in the underbrush
by the lake. By and by I spied Mrs. Batterly’s
canoe, and I got in and paddled away as fast as I
could. I remembered the hollow stump, because
I’d gone there for Mrs. Batterly with fudge for
Joey; and when I saw it I just popped the revolver
inside. Then I hid the canoe among the willows
and started to walk to Roselake. I kept to
the woods along the river road until I heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
stage coming, and then I thought ‘I’ll go to Sister
Veronica at the Old Mission.’ And I ran out
and hailed it, and got in. When the stage got to
De Smet that evening a man got in, and I heard
him tell the driver that Mrs. Batterly had been arrested
for the murder of her husband. So then
I knew I had to tell the truth and take the blame
or they’d keep her in jail and drag her through
an awful trial, and I knew what that would mean
to you, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>I pressed her head closer against my shoulder.
“Wanza,” I said, “you are a noble girl.”</p>

<p>The tears welled up in the cornflower blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dale, you do believe that Mr. Batterly
was most respectful to me whenever I met
him in the village! He was very polite and respectful.
I never spoke to him but three times.
Once dad was with me, and once Joey, and once I
was alone.”</p>

<p>There was something piteous in her asseveration.</p>

<p>“I am sure he was respectful, child.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to die the minute he spoke too bold
to me when he found me there alone at Hidden
Lake.”</p>

<p>“I well know that, Wanza.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Marna of the quick disdain,</div>
<div class="verse">Starting at the dream of stain!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I cleared my throat and spoke as hopefully as
I could. “Let us forget as well as we can, little
girl. Let us look forward to your release. You
will tell the truth at the trial, and you will be believed.
And then—you will forget—you will
start all over again! You must let me help you,
Wanza, in many ways. I have a piece of good
news for you even now. I have found Joey.”</p>

<p>But I did not tell her Joey’s story, until my
next visit.</p>

<p>I learned from Haidee’s attorney that Randall
Batterly had been buried in Roselake cemetery,
and that Mrs. Olds had been sent for and was
staying with Haidee. That afternoon Buttons
carried a double burden over the trail to Hidden
Lake. I went in alone to Haidee, leaving Joey
in the woods. My heart was too overcharged for
free speech, but I told Haidee that I had found
Joey in an abandoned cabin and I told her all that
Wanza had told me of the part she had played
in the accidental shooting of Randall Batterly,
and later I said to her:</p>

<p>“I have something strange to communicate to
you. But first, I am going to ask you if you will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
tell me the story of your life after you became
Randall Batterly’s wife.”</p>

<p>Haidee lifted her head at my request and
straightened her shoulders with an indrawn spasmodic
breath. “I have always intended to tell
you my story, some day,” she answered. Lines
of pain etched themselves upon her brow.</p>

<p>“I think if you will tell me you will not regret
it,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I have always intended to tell you,” she repeated.
Her voice shook but she lifted brave
eyes to mine, and began her story.</p>

<p>“I married Randall Batterly eight years ago,
when I was eighteen, soon after my father died.
He took me to Alaska, and—and Baby was born
there. When my little one was two years old, I
had a very severe attack of pneumonia. While I
was still ill Mr. Batterly was obliged to make a
trip to Seattle, and it was decided that Baby was
to go with him, and be left with my mother there
until I was stronger,—I think the good nurse
I had scarcely expected me to recover. Mr. Batterly
had always been a drinking man, though I
was unaware of this when I married him. On the
steamer he drank so heavily that he was in his
stateroom in a drunken stupor most of the time,
he afterwards confessed. Then—there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
storm and a collision in the night—and the ship
Mr. Batterly was on went down off Cape Flattery.
Mr. Batterly was rescued by a man who
shared his stateroom—a man he had known for
years. But my little boy—my Baby—was never
seen again.”</p>

<p>In the silence that followed, Haidee shuddered
and closed her eyes, biting her lips that were
writhing and gray. After a short interval she
went on in a low, strained tone:</p>

<p>“Mr. Batterly and I parted soon after. My
mother died that summer and I went to Paris to
study art. While in Paris last winter, in a
Seattle paper, I read of Mr. Batterly’s death at
Nome. His name was probably confused with
that of his partner. I did not know he had a
partner. This spring I returned to America,
and with a sudden longing for the West I came
out to visit Janet Jones in Spokane. It was then
I was obsessed with the desire to paint this beautiful
river country. Janet Jones aided and
abetted me. I purchased a riding horse and went
to board on a ranch near Kingman. It was
deadly. When I walked into your workshop I
had ridden all day, fully determined to find a
habitation of my own.”</p>

<p>I had glanced at Haidee once or twice to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
that her eyes were still closed. But now, as she
finished, she opened them wide, and at the look of
misery I saw in them I cried out quickly:</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me any more—please—please—”</p>

<p>“There is nothing more to tell,” she answered
dully.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your confidence. Before I
told you all I have to tell I thought it best to ask
it of you.”</p>

<p>“You have something to tell me? For you
things are righting—you have found your boy!
For me everything seems wrong in the world—everything!
But now—may I see Joey, please,
before long?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Batterly,” I asked, “may I tell you
Joey’s short history?”</p>

<p>At my abrupt tone she turned her eyes to mine,
wonderingly. “Surely,” she replied.</p>

<p>“It is a pitifully meagre one. I found him
sobbing on the doorstep of a humble cabin, one
night, four years ago last June. I took him in
my arms and entered the place, to find within a
dying woman. She told me that the child was a
waif, picked up on the beach after a storm on
Puget Sound, by her brother, who was a fisherman,
a year before. Her brother had died six
months previous and she had taken the child.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
The woman passed away that night, and I carried
the child home. Mrs. Batterly, your husband
gleaned this story from Wanza. He took Joey
and secreted him in a cabin, thinking the lad his
child and yours—”</p>

<p>Haidee broke in on my recital with a gasping
cry: “My child—mine?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Batterly, was there a mark on your
baby’s chest—a mark you could identify him by?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!—a bright red mark—oh, not large—the
size of a quarter—just over his heart.”</p>

<p>“Joey has such a mark, though it is a mark considerably
larger than a quarter—and it is higher
than his heart.”</p>

<p>A doubt that I was ashamed of stirred my
breast, seeing the eagerness on the face before me.
A doubt that returned later during forlorn hard
days to haunt me. I said to myself that I knew
not even on what shore of the great Sound Joey
was discovered. But Haidee was speaking impetuously:</p>

<p>“He has grown—the mark has grown too, and
is higher up! I have a scar on my forehead almost
hidden by my hair that was much lower
down when I was a child.” She rose, her face
working, her whole slight figure quivering. “Oh,
Mr. Dale, give me my child!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>I went to the door and gave my whistle and
Joey responded. Haidee took him in her arms,
and he told his story to her much as he had told it
to me. But when he finished, he looked up in
her face questioningly:</p>

<p>“I won’t have to leave Mr. David, will I?” he
queried. “He’s my only really, truly daddy.
He’d be terrible lonesome without me. Why, I
most guess he couldn’t get along without me, Bell
Brandon!”</p>

<p>“Dear, dear little boy, don’t you understand?
You have a mother, now.” Haidee’s arms held
him close. Her cheek rested against his. Looking
at her I hated myself for the pang I felt.</p>

<p>And so my little lad went out of my keeping.
I left him with Haidee and went back to take up
my niggardly existence at Cedar Dale.</p>

<p>Anxious days ensued. My heart was heavy
with thoughts of Wanza, I could not eat nor
sleep. And every day Griffith Lyttle and I consulted
together, and held wearing conclaves in the
office of Wanza’s attorney. And someway I
found myself distrait and unnatural in Haidee’s
presence and consumed with bitter melancholy
when alone.</p>

<p>What had come over me? When I was with
Haidee all my speech was of Wanza. When I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
was alone all my thoughts were of her. Haidee
was free—but I realized this but dimly. The
thought of Wanza’s position was paramount. In
the long night vigils I saw her face. I recalled
the look I had surprised on it once—the secret
never intended for my reading—and my compassion
and wonder overpowered me. That Wanza
should care for me!—I felt like falling on my
knees in humbleness.</p>

<p>My loneliness was intense. I began to realize
that Joey had gone out of my life—that his place
was henceforth not with me—never with me
again.</p>

<p>The love of a man for a small boy is composed
of various ingredients, it has spice in it, and tenderness,
and pride, and hope, and fellowship—and
a lilt of melody goes through it that lightens
the most rigid days of discipline. So when the
small boy goes out of the home, the man is bereft
of joy and inspiration and companionship. At
first I went daily to Hidden Lake, and Joey came
daily to Cedar Dale. But one day when Joey
was begging me to make him a bow-gun I surprised
a wistful gleam in Haidee’s soft eyes.
She drew the lad into her arms.</p>

<p>“Mother will buy you a wonderful gun,” she
promised.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>“But I’d rather have Mr. David make it, Bell
Brandon. I guess women don’t know what boys
like—just.”</p>

<p>The hurt look in the purple-black eyes went to
my heart. After that I went not so often to Hidden
Lake.</p>

<p>I took to using Joey’s room as a sort of study.
I fitted up a desk near the window, and here I
wrote on my novel, and wrought at wood carving
for the Christmas trade. Finding me here one
day carving a frame for an old photograph of
Wanza, Haidee looked at me oddly, turned
swiftly and went from the room, while Joey
stared eagerly, and whispered:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. David, some day I’m coming back to
stay in my dear old room. Tain’t nice at Bell
Brandon’s for a boy. They’s a white spread on
the bed, and blue ribbons to tie back the curtains.
And when the coyotes holler Bell Brandon’s
frightened too.”</p>

<p>Later on the porch at parting, Haidee said to
me:</p>

<p>“Have you worked long on the frame you are
carving for Wanza’s picture?”</p>

<p>“Since—oh, I began it about the time Joey
was lost,” I answered.</p>

<p>She looked at me curiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>“Wanza is very lovely in that picture.”</p>

<p>“She is. She is growing more beautiful every
day,” I answered thoughtfully; “her soul shines
in her face. I realize each time I see her how her
character is rounding—how sturdy and fine she is
in her trouble.”</p>

<p>After Haidee had gone I recalled the look she
had flung at me as she turned and went down the
steps, saying:</p>

<p>“Wanza is very fortunate to have you for a
friend, very fortunate indeed.”</p>

<p>I asked myself what her look had meant.</p>

<p>Another week passed. I finished my novel.
And one day soon after I rode to Roselake, expressed
the manuscript to a publishing firm, and
rode homeward feeling that my affairs were on
the knees of the gods.</p>

<p>Not far from Cedar Dale I left the road and
took the trail that led through the woods. In the
woods I dismounted and went forward slowly,
my horse’s bridle on my arm. It was a gray day,
lightened by a yellow haze. I was enraptured
with the peculiar light that came through the
trees. The foliage about me was copper and
flame. Presently I heard voices, and looking
through the trees I saw Haidee and Joey. They
were kneeling in a little open space, gathering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
pine cones. Haidee was bareheaded and her
sleeves were rolled back, exposing her round,
white arms. Her figure was lithe and supple as
she knelt there, her drooping face full of witchery
and charm.</p>

<p>I had an opportunity to observe Joey well.
His face was thinner, his carriage not so gallant
as formerly. There was less buoyancy in his
voice. Something sprightly was missing in his
whole aspect,—a certain confidence and dare.
He was not the Cedar Dale elf I had known.
What had changed him so?</p>

<p>I went forward and Joey cried out and hurled
himself into my arms. Haidee stood up and
drew the lad to her with a nervous motion.</p>

<p>“Joey,” I said, “run away and see what Jingles
is barking at so furiously. A fat rabbit has just
escaped him.”</p>

<p>Joey bounded away shrieking with excitement.
I studied Haidee deliberately as her eyes followed
the childish figure. Her eyes were brooding
and solemn and sweet as she watched, but
there was a shadow on her brow.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” I said speaking out my thought,
“for Joey’s mother to be jealous of me.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that of me?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“He is all yours—no one on the face of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span>
earth has the slightest claim on him excepting
yourself.”</p>

<p>Our eyes met; hers were startled yet defiant;
and I am afraid mine were a trifle accusing.</p>

<p>“Do not speak to me like this—do not dare!”
Then suddenly she softened. “But you are right—perhaps.
When I think of the days and
months you had him and I was bereft—when I
think how much you mean to him—more than I
mean—oh, it hurts! I am a wretch.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I said hastily. “I did not understand,
that is all.”</p>

<p>“You have not understood—and it has altered
your manner to me, that is it, is it not? You have
thought me weak, and selfish, and ungrateful.
Well, I am not ungrateful; but I have been selfish.
I have thought not enough of you and
Joey. But now I have confessed, and I shall be
more considerate.” Her hand came out to me.
“Let us shake hands.” Tears were in her eyes.</p>

<p>I took her hand with shame and contrition. I
reached home utterly miserable. Had Haidee
changed or had I changed? What had come
over us? The spontaneity and warmth had
seeped from our friendship. There seemed to be
a shadow between us that each was futile to lift.</p>

<p>I said to myself that when I heard from my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
novel—if the word was favorable—I should go to
her—I could at least tell her of my hopes for the
future—I could lay my love at her feet. All
should be made plain; the cloud should be dispersed.</p>

<p>And so the weeks went past.</p>

<small>WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE day close on to Christmas, Wanza
was tried for the murder of Randall
Batterly, and after a record-breaking
trial that lasted but five hours, acquitted. The
verdict said that Randall Batterly was killed by
the accidental discharge of a revolver dropped by
his own hand.</p>

<p>In the twilight of that strange day I drove
Wanza to her home, where old Grif Lyttle
awaited her. It was a gray twilight, the snow
was drifted into gleaming heaps on either side of
the road, the river crawled darkly along between
its fleecy banks. We found no words to say at
first, but when I heard a sob in Wanza’s throat
I turned and put my arm across her shoulders.</p>

<p>“There, there, Wanza!” I whispered, soothingly.</p>

<p>She wept quietly. Presently she said, between
smiles and tears:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>“It will soon be Christmas. I will try to give
father a good Christmas, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“There, there, Wanza,” I said, again.</p>

<p>She drew away, and with both hands pushed
back the hood that she had drawn over her face
on leaving the jail.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Batterly wants to send me away, soon
after Christmas—away back East to school—where
I can forget,” she faltered.</p>

<p>Her blue eyes widened to great round wells of
misery, the tears rained down her altered cheeks.</p>

<p>“You will forget,” I soothed her; “it was an
accident, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Mr. Dale, I <i>felt</i> that I could kill him—for
being so disrespectful to me—for speaking
so bold—for kissing me! I had murder in my
heart! I remember one night in the woods when
we were gipsying—do you mind it, Mr. Dale?—you
took my hands, and I thought you was going
to kiss me, you looked at me so long, but you
didn’t—you respected me too much! Why if
you had ’a kissed me—not loving me—Mr. Dale,
it would’a killed me. And I think I could almost
’a killed you.”</p>

<p>I looked into her face, and suddenly I was
back again in the wind-stirred forest with the
black elf-locks of a gipsy wench brushing my lips,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
her hands held close, her eyes, burningly blue,
lifted to mine in the firelight. I heard her voice
whispering: “If I was a gipsy, and you was a
gipsy things would be different.” I recalled the
words of the song I had sung:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Marna of the wind’s will,</div>
<div class="verse">Daughter of the sea—”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I sighed. Marna of the wind’s will, indeed!</p>

<p>This conversation left a sore spot in my heart.
I was dejected and miserable for days. The day
before Christmas arrived and late in the afternoon
I rode into Roselake. I purchased some
bolts for a sled I was making for Joey, got my
mail, and returned home at dusk.</p>

<p>I built a fire at once in the fireplace in the front
room, and went over my mail eagerly by the light
of my green-shaded lamp. One envelope bore
the New York postmark, and I opened it with
nervous fingers. I read the communication it
contained, and sat, a warm, surging joy transfusing
my whole being. The publishing firm in
New York had accepted my novel for publication,
and the terms mentioned were generous beyond
my wildest visionings.</p>

<p>There was another communication that I read
over and over; and as I read I knew that I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>
free at last—yes, free forever—free to ask any
woman in the world to be my wife; I knew that
the search light of justice could be turned on a
folded page of my past that had long been hidden,
and that there would be no tarnish on the
page. For the letter said that my poor old
father was dead, and in dying had confessed to a
forgery committed eight years ago—a crime
which his son had tacitly admitted himself to be
guilty of when he had stolen away under cover of
the night and disappeared, rather than face an
investigation.</p>

<p>The daily papers had blazoned abroad the
shooting of Randall Batterly, and the subsequent
trial of Wanza Lyttle, and my name had appeared
in the account, the writer who was my
father’s lawyer explained. A letter to the postmaster
at Roselake had resulted in further establishing
my identity.</p>

<p>The writer had the honor to inform me that my
father had left a snug little fortune—the result
of some recent fortunate mining ventures—that
would accrue to me, and he begged me to come
back to my southern home and take my rightful
place among the people. I shook my head at
this. Who was there in the old home who would
welcome me? My mother was long since dead—my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
father gone. There was no one belonging to
me left in the old place. It would be more
strange and forlorn than an entirely new community.
I should like to visit it again. But that
was all.</p>

<p>I dropped the letter to the floor, and sat thinking
of Haidee. And as I thought I smiled tenderly.
After a time I decided that Haidee
should see these important letters—that I should
go to her. And on a sudden impulse I rose up.</p>

<p>As I opened the door the snow was falling, and
there was a ring around the moon. I left the
door open and stepped back into the house, going
to the cedar room to get my sweater. When I
returned, a woman with snow-powdered hair was
stepping hesitatingly across the threshold. Haidee!</p>

<p>“It is you! Out so late—alone!” I began.
“And in this storm.”</p>

<p>But the big eyes only smiled at me, and she
stood there like a beautiful wraith in her long
gray cloak.</p>

<p>“Let me take your cloak,” I said.</p>

<p>I went to her, and she put both hands on my
shoulders impulsively.</p>

<p>“I haven’t thought of the weather. Ever since
I saw you last I’ve thought of you,—and thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
and thought. It’s Christmas Eve, you know. I
have come to wish you a Merry Christmas, and I
have brought you a Christmas gift—one to keep
till spring, at least.”</p>

<p>“Come to the fire,” I urged.</p>

<p>She sat down and I sat down opposite her.
The firelight caressed her, played in her eyes,
ruddied her cheeks that were glowing from her
walk through the wintry air.</p>

<p>“In all the time I have known you this is the
first time I have ever shared your fire,” she whispered.</p>

<p>There was a silence. I could hear my heart-beats.
How fine of her to come to me in this
womanly fashion! I sat and watched her. A
lock of hair had fallen over her ivory brow. She
had dropped her head forward on to her hand,
and her dewy lips were parted. I stooped closer,
closer still. A tear slipped down on her smooth
cheek and glistened in the firelight as I gazed.
She turned her face away.</p>

<p>“What gift have you brought me?” I whispered.</p>

<p>There was a movement in the shadows beyond
the circle of light cast by the green-shaded lamp—a
rustle and a stir—then a swift hurtling of a
small lithe figure across the open space—a pause—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
swooping, frantic clutch of young strong
arms about my neck, and Joey, all wet and steaming
in his snowy coat, had me fast, shouting in my
ear, over and over again:</p>

<p>“I’m your Christmas gift, Mr. David! I’m
your Christmas gift.”</p>

<p>He was in my arms, and Haidee had drawn
back and was smiling at me, her eyes like great
luminous pools of fire.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful, wonderful present,” I responded
shakily. “Now, who could have sent
me this very best present in the world?”</p>

<p>“Bell Brandon,” shrieked my little lad. “She
did not send me—she brought me.”</p>

<p>“Then—she must have another gift for me,”
I said boldly, and held out my hand to Haidee.</p>

<p>She shook her head, her eyes grave, but her
lips still smiling.</p>

<p>“I have brought Joey to you—but—I cannot
stay. I am going away. Will you keep my boy
until I return?”</p>

<p>“You are going away?”</p>

<p>She bent her head.</p>

<p>“I am going to take Wanza back East. I
want to go away for a time—it is best for me to
go. But—you must not be separated from Joey
all this long winter, David Dale. My boy shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
stay with you—and in the spring I shall come for
him—or come back to stay at Hidden Lake.”</p>

<p>“You are going away—soon—after Christmas?”</p>

<p>“To-morrow. We are going to-morrow—Wanza
and I—we decided it only to-day. I
have some matters to attend to in New York. I
must go at once.”</p>

<p>“Christmas Day?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Wait—do not go—stay with me as my wife,
my wife! I have sold my book—I am free too,
of an old, old shadow. Oh, I have much to tell
you—much to talk over with you. Wait—let me
read to you some letters.”</p>

<p>My voice was rough with emotion. She held
up her hand.</p>

<p>“When I come back, David Dale, my friend—not
now. We need to gain perspective—you
and I. I have been through an ordeal—I am
shaken—I am not myself. I don’t see clearly.
And as for you—David Dale, there is much for
you to learn.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I cried brusquely.</p>

<p>She smiled at me sweetly and a little sadly.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are a stupid blundering David.”
She shook her head. “But—wait till spring.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>“There is so much I want to say—explain,” I
stammered.</p>

<p>“Wait till spring.”</p>

<p>“But I cannot keep Joey. I cannot let you
go without your boy.”</p>

<p>“He will be better off with you.”</p>

<p>“I cannot accept such a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>On this point I remained firm. We argued.
Haidee entreated, and Joey begged to be allowed
to stay. I would not listen to either voice. I
arose at last.</p>

<p>“Joey,” I said, speaking slowly, in order to
steady my voice, “I have one more bolt to put
in the sled I am making for you. Will you come
to the workshop with me?”</p>

<p>And in the shop away from every eye, I said
good-bye to my lad. And as I kissed him the
old doubt stirred. Was I so sure he was
Haidee’s child?</p>

<p>Old Lundquist came for Haidee; and we said
a conventional good-bye beneath his prying eyes.</p>

<p>Until twelve I waited and watched for Wanza,
expecting every instant to hear Captain Grif’s
voice at the door, and to see Wanza step over the
threshold. Surely she would not go without
some last word to me. But she came not.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>“THE FLOWER WILL BLOOM ANOTHER YEAR”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &#160;SAT by my fire throughout the long night.
When dawn came I rose, went to the door
and threw it wide and stepped outside into
the unstained air of the morning. There was a
carpet of snow on the ground, the bushes were
like gleaming teepes, and the limbs of the pine
trees were weighted with icicles. I repeated to
myself Thoreau’s words: “God exhibits himself
in a frosted bush to-day, as much as he did in a
burning one to Moses.”</p>

<p>The light was purple and cold and solemn, the
moon still hung in the gray of the western sky,
but in the East there was a glorious band of
crimson and the mountain tops looked as if aflame
with little bonfires. As I stood there a ruby-crowned
kinglet fluttered from twig to twig of
the elderberry bush hard by, emitting its bright
“zei, zei,” and a chickadee answered with a
merry “chickadee-a-dee, dee, dee,” from the yew
grove. I waited. I was praying the kinglet
would sing. And presently the tiny thing began.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span>
It poured forth its strong sweet notes in a succession
of trills.</p>

<p>“Bird,” I said, “you are a wonder. I know
that the muscles in your throat are almost microscopic.
I have always told Joey—” But here
I ceased to admonish the bird, I went back up the
porch steps.</p>

<p>As I was closing the door I heard the rattle
of the stage as it passed along the river road on
its way to the village. The driver shouted a
merry Christmas to some one on the road. I
threw a fresh log on the fire and sat down heavily
in my chair. It was Christmas morning—and
they had gone!</p>

<p>I drowsed after a time, lying back in my great
chair with the collie asleep at my feet. When I
awakened the sun was high, and the world outside
my window was so sparkling and bright that it
dazzled my sight. I went to the kitchen, kindled
a fire, and opened the kitchen door to let the collie
out. I was washing my hands at the wash-bench
in the corner, when I heard the latch of the door
click. Footsteps crossed the floor, some one was
coming up behind me saying:</p>

<p>“I have brought a chicken pie for your dinner,
Mr. Dale—Dad’ll be along soon—and I wish you
a Merry Christmas.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span>It was Wanza.</p>

<p>She stood there as she had so often stood before,
a white-covered basket on one arm, the other
filled with bundles. But her face was pale to-day,
and her glorious hair was swept straight
back from her brow and tucked away beneath a
net, and her apparel was sober gray. I stared at
her and stared and stared, until the pink ran up
in her cheek and she dropped the bundles and set
down the basket, that she might put her hands
over her abashed face. I stood there and felt
shaken and dumbfounded, not attempting to
speak, afraid indeed of the sound of my own
voice.</p>

<p>The fire crackled. Cheerily through the door
Wanza had left open behind her, came the
chickadee’s note. The sunlight was dazzling as
it struck into my eyes from the white oilcloth on
the kitchen table. The room seemed suddenly
illumined, the air electric and revitalized. At
length I stammered out:</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you!”</p>

<p>“It’s only chicken pie,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Thank you for not going.”</p>

<p>At that she threw up her head, her hands
dropped. She said proudly:</p>

<p>“Did you think I’d go on Christmas Day?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[322]</span>
Did you think I’d have the heart to go, Mr.
Dale?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said wearily, “I thought you had
gone, Wanza. Why not?”</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell you why not! It’s because you
decided Joey was to go that I could <i>not</i> go. I
could not go and leave you when I found Joey
was to go—oh, no!”</p>

<p>“But you must go some day, Wanza,” I said,
scarce knowing what I said.</p>

<p>“And why must I go some day? Why must
I? I tell you what I’m going to do, Mr. David
Dale, I’m going to stay on here in Roselake, and
I am going to live up to the very best there is in
me. I am going to improve and grow big and
fine and womanly. I’m going to do it right here.
And then maybe some day,” she sighed, “when
Dad does not need me any more, and you do not
need me any more, I will have enough money
saved up, and I will go away and get educated.”</p>

<p>In her excitement she had pressed closer to me
and laid one hand against my chest. I placed my
own hand over it as I said very gently:</p>

<p>“Let me teach you, Wanza—be my pupil. I
will become your tutor in earnest, if you will have
me. Yes! I will go to your father’s house every
day to instruct you,—and it will give me great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span>
happiness. Ah, Wanza, now that Joey has gone
I feel so futile—so useless! Let me undertake
your education, child.”</p>

<p>The burning eyes came up to mine, and questioned
them. The pale face flushed. There was
a pathetic tremulousness about the lips.</p>

<p>“Say yes,” I urged.</p>

<p>Her head drooped, lowered itself humbly until
her hair brushed my arm, and suddenly she kissed
my hand, passionately, gratefully. “Oh, Mr.
David Dale,” she breathed, “you’re grand!
That’s what you are. Yes and yes, and yes!”</p>

<p>And so I ate my dinner with Wanza and
Captain Grif sitting opposite me at the table, and
Wanza flouted me when I would have served her
too liberally with the most succulent bits of the
pie, and Captain Grif rallied me when I confessed
that I had small appetite, and produced
a bottle of root beer and a bag of cheese cakes
from the basket.</p>

<p>Night came down at last to my weary soul and
soon after it grew dark Wanza and her father
departed. I locked the door behind them and I
threw myself, dressed as I was, on my bunk and
buried my head in the pillows. The evening
wore on. The fire sputtered and burned low, the
wind came up and hissed around the cabin. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[324]</span>
coyote howled from some distant hill. The room
grew dark. A pall was on my heart.</p>

<p>As the winter wore on I became vastly interested
in Wanza’s education. I gave two hours
each day to her lessons. And not many evenings
passed without lessons in the snug little room
beneath the eaves of the cottage she called home.
There with our books open before us, beneath the
light from the swinging lamp, we pored over
tedious pages shoulder to shoulder, smiled on by
old Grif and encouraged by Father O’Shan, who
ofttimes shared our evenings.</p>

<p>It was wonderful the improvement I marked
in Wanza as the weeks slipped past. Her English
improved markedly. She was painstaking
and indefatigable. She applied herself so assiduously
that I began to fear lest she should
overwork, as the warm spring days came
on.</p>

<p>“Don’t study too hard,” I cautioned her one
day.</p>

<p>“I can’t study too hard,” she flashed back at
me. And then she smiled. But I knew she was
terribly in earnest.</p>

<p>It was that same day that Father O’Shan
quoted to me, as we were walking along the river
road together:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Shed no tear—Oh, shed no tear!</div>
<div class="verse">The flower will bloom another year.</div>
<div class="verse">Weep no more—Oh, weep no more!</div>
<div class="verse">Young buds sleep in the root’s white core.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Do you mean that for me, Father?” I asked.</p>

<p>“For you—yes. And many like you.”</p>

<p>My heart swelled. I looked about me. Buttercups
were gilding the sod—the pussy willows
were in bloom along the river. It was the spring.</p>

<p>I went home and raked the dead leaves and
pine needles away from under the trees in the
Dingle. A few yellow violets were springing
up. From beyond the syringa thicket a faint
“witchery, witchery, witchery,” greeted my ears.</p>

<p>I went forward cautiously. Peering through
the interlaced branches I saw the songster. He
was swinging on a thorn bush, a wonderfully
brilliant little chorister in his black cap and
yellow stole. I whistled. He cocked his head
on one side, fixed me with his bright eye, then flew
to a willow tree and favored me with another
burst of song. This time he seemed to oft repeat,
“Which way, oh?” He sang it so persistently
that presently I replied, “Straight on,
sir.”</p>

<p>I went to the cabin and consulted the calendar.
It was the last day of March.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[326]</span>My spirit, that had seemed earthward crushed
for months, grew lighter in the sweet spring days
that followed. I took the return of April as a
long-fore-gone right. I ploughed and planted,
I made bird houses and arranged bird-baths in
the groves hard by the cabin. I paddled in my
canoe on the river, and fished in the adjacent
creeks. And I went with Wanza through the
woods on many a trillium hunt.</p>

<p>Sometimes almost to breathlessness I felt
Wanza’s charm, the galvanism she could always
transmit to those with her intensified by some new
strange quality I could not name. It was like
a fillip given my dispassion. When she laughed
and chirped to the squirrels, when she carried a
wounded bird in her breast, when she stood on
tip-toe, her face like a taper-flame, to greet the
whole outdoors with wide-flung arms, I caught
my lip between my teeth and watched her with
observant eyes. Her beauty grew. Even
Father O’Shan remarked it. The gowns of pink
she wore once served to deepen the rose tint in
her fair cheeks; but her cheeks needed no such
service now; they were like a red-rose heart. She
had taken to smoothing and banding her hair and
twisting it back behind her small ears with big
shell pins. Her head seen thus was as lovely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span>
a shape as any Greuze ever painted. She
frequently wore thin blouses of white, and I
seldom saw her feet in sandals—she had a sleeveless
black gown that she wore to a country dance
one evening when I was her escort. Looking at
her that night I could scarcely believe it was
Wanza, my old friend and playmate whom I was
in attendance upon, and I paid her some rather
silly compliments and was promptly rebuked for
my gallantry.</p>

<p>It was a tidy enough fortune my dear old
father had left me. I had been able to do many
things to make Wanza and Captain Grif comfortable
and happy during the long winter.
Among other things I had purchased a piano for
Wanza to replace the old melodeon, and delighted
Captain Grif with the gift of a phonograph.
And last, but not least, I had made the last payment
on the little cottage in which they lived and
presented the deed to Captain Grif on his sixty-fifth
birthday.</p>

<p>Dear Captain Grif! His manner of accepting
this last gift was characteristic.</p>

<p>“Tain’t for myself I’d take it. I’d just about
as lief worry along and save and scrimp toward
makin’ the final payment— I ’low I’d <i>sooner</i>;
I like the glory, and when you have a soft thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
handed to you there ben’t nothin’ achieved. I’m
meanin’ it, s-ship-mate. Things we earn is the
things we ’preciate. But I take it kindly of you.
And for Wanza’s sake I thank you and accept.
’Tis hard on the gal—pinchin’ and scrimpin’—and
peddlin’ in winter is about played out—the
roads is in bad shape for gettin’ about, you’ll ’low.
Now with the house paid for, the gal’ll have what
she earns for ribbons and furbelows and trinkets.
And ownin’ sech a face as hern, Mr. Dale—though
it don’t need no adornin’—sure makes a
gal long for fixin’s. I’m grateful and pleased
for her sake—I sure be.” Tears dimmed his
kind old eyes. His hand came out to me.
“Shake hands, David Dale, man; you’re a friend—a
friend. We need friends—the gal and I—seems
like we need ’em more’n we used since all
we been through,—and I want to say right here
that Wanza never would’a perked up if it hadn’t
a been for your helpin’ her this winter. She was
pretty well down, Wanza was. Well, in my
youth, young folks was different. I used to
think—I used to think one time—well, there,
by golly, s-ship-mate, it makes no difference <i>what</i>
I used to think! I was mistook, I ’low. It sure
is great for a man and gal to be such friends as
you and Wanza—no foolishness—no tomfoolery!—it’s
unusual—I ain’t sayin’ that it tain’t—but
it’s fine, s-ship-mate, it’s fine.”</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_328.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“I’M GRATEFUL AND PLEASED”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>Through the winter I had had frequent letters
from Haidee—frank, friendly letters, filled with
stories of Joey—and a few printed epistles from
the lad; one in particular that impressed me;
“Joey is all rite,” it said.</p>

<p>I discussed this with Wanza, who said tearfully:</p>

<p>“His saying that makes me think he isn’t. He
is such a plucky little chap. He would not have
you worrying. Not that I think he’s sick—sure
enough sick, you know; but I just feel sure he’s
pining.”</p>

<p>“Please—please, Wanza, don’t put that
thought into my mind,” I said hastily. “If I
thought Joey were happy I could more easily
bear his absence.”</p>

<p>She looked at me and shook her head. Then
she smiled.</p>

<p>“He’ll do well enough till spring. But he will
be counting the days, all right.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>MY SURPRISE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN May came I began to look forward
in earnest to the return of
Haidee and Joey. Every day since
the beginning of spring I had gone to Hidden
Lake to tend the vines and shrubs that I had set
out with so much care the previous fall. I had
also made a flower bed and planted the seeds of
many old-fashioned flowers—larkspur, Sweet
William, marigolds, phlox, lobelia, clove pinks
and mignonette, sweet peas and rosemary. In
another few weeks the little cabin would be surrounded
by bloom.</p>

<p>A Vigor’s wren was building a nest in the
pergola, and a calliope humming-bird’s nest
hung on a pine limb near the kitchen door, not
more than eight feet above the ground. I could
scarcely wait for Joey to see the latter. The
hours I spent at Hidden Lake were filled with
strange anticipations, and unanswered questions
and grim wonderment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>But Fate had a surprise in store for me.</p>

<p>One day as I stood looking at the humming-bird’s
nest a man approached the cabin from the
wood path beyond the garden. He was a hard-faced
man, a grizzled, uncouth figure of a man.
I took an instant dislike to him without even
waiting to see his features. When he saw me
he halted irresolutely. I nodded to him carelessly,
and stooped to pull a stray weed from the
bed of thyme beside the kitchen door. When I
looked up he stood beside me.</p>

<p>“Good day, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good day,” I returned.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Batterly to home?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “Mrs. Batterly is in the East.”</p>

<p>“Is her cabin shut up?”</p>

<p>“It is,” I said curtly.</p>

<p>“Well, I swan! Say, did she take the kid with
her?”</p>

<p>“She took the little boy with her, certainly.”</p>

<p>He grinned, showing blackened teeth and unsightly
gums. “Um,” he said, half shutting his
red-lidded eyes, “um, um—you’re Mr. Dale, I
take it; I have seen you in the village.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am David Dale,” I answered
straightening up. “Is there anything I can do
for you?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>He guffawed. “No,” he chuckled, “you can’t
do a darn thing for me, but you bet your gosh
darned boots I can do something for you.”</p>

<p>I turned away in disgust.</p>

<p>“Say, partner,” he pulled me round to him by
the sleeve, “I reckon that Mrs. Batterly took the
kid with her thinking the kid was hern. Well,
he ain’t!”</p>

<p>I gaped at him. He grinned at me in a would-be
friendly manner.</p>

<p>“My name’s Bill Jobson. I’m a miner,” he
volunteered.</p>

<p>“That means nothing to me,” I told him
sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I don’t suppose it does! See
here! I’m the man as helped Randall Batterly
kidnap your boy, Joey— Wait a minute, wait
a minute! Don’t get excited. It was a frame
up—the whole darn thing! Batterly never had
no idea the kid was his. He framed the whole
thing up to get a rise out of his wife. He was
set on getting her back, and he took that way of
doing it. He knew mighty well the kid warn’t
his. His own boy died from an over-dose of
medicine Batterly gave it one night when he was
drunk, on board the ship him and me was on
going from Alaska to Seattle. The boy died in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
my arms, and was buried at sea. Batterly
wouldn’t go back to Alaska and face his wife
and tell her the truth about the child. He made
me swear not to squeak. And he went back, and
he let on to his wife that the child was never seen
after the collision between our ship and another,
in the fog, off Cape Flattery. He told his wife
as how a nurse on board ship had the babe in her
stateroom, caring for it, the night of the wreck.
There was a nurse on board who was drowned
that night, so the story passed muster.”</p>

<p>I watched the man with fascinated eyes as he
sat down on the doorstep, filled his pipe leisurely,
and struck a match on his boot heel. The full
import of his statement did not sink into my brain
at once. When it did I said, speaking with dry
lips:</p>

<p>“But what about the mark on the lad’s
chest?”</p>

<p>“That’s what you call a coincidence, partner—that
and their age seeming to be the same.
When Batterly saw the mark on the kid’s chest
the whole blame plan came to him quick as
lightning, he said. And when the girl, Wanza
Lyttle, told him as how he was picked up by a
fisherman over on the Sound, that settled it. He
took a chance on his wife’s not remembering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
mark on her kid’s chest was just over his heart.
This kid’s is higher up.”</p>

<p>Completely unmanned, I sat down on the step
beside my visitor, and rested my head in my
hands. “It does not seem possible your story is
true,” I groaned.</p>

<p>Bill Jobson brought his hand down hard on my
knee. “Look ahere, Mr. Dale, do you think I
tramped way over here from Roselake to see Mrs.
Batterly just because I wanted a country stroll?
Well, I didn’t! Get that through your head—quick!
I’m a busy man— I oughtn’t to have
took the time to come and say my say as I
have—”</p>

<p>“Will you write a statement and have it witnessed,
and send it to Mrs. Batterly?” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“I will that. And I’ll tell you why I’m doing
it. I’m doing it because I used to see the little
chap with you in the village last summer and I
saw him after that in the fall with Mrs. Batterly,
and he never run and skipped as he did with you.
It just got me for fair—it did! I’ve been intending
all this winter to see Batterly’s widder and
tell her the gosh darned truth, but I been working
in the Alice mine, a good fifty mile from Roselake,
and I ain’t been down but once before since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
fall, and that time I—well, I got pickled, partner,
I sure did! I wa’n’t exactly up to holding lucid
conversation with folks, you might say.”</p>

<p>I was silenced.</p>

<p>That night the statement was written in the
presence of Captain Grif, Wanza, and Father
O’Shan, and it went forward with a letter from
me to Haidee.</p>

<p>Wanza and I waited impatiently for a return
letter from Haidee. But the days went past
like shadows, and no letter came. I had been
climbing upward toward the summit of comparative
peace, I had almost reached it when Bill
Jobson came with his disclosure. But now,
hearing nothing from my wonder woman, the
valley closed around me. I walked in a stagnant
marsh, the atmosphere was that of the lowland.</p>

<p>One night some three weeks after the letter
from Haidee should have reached me, I found
myself unable to sleep. I arose and dressed, and
went outside and walked along the river road
toward the village. After going some distance
I lay down beneath a tree in a pine grove. It
was about two o’clock. A purple darkness lay
all around me. The stars were like pale gems,
clear and cool and polished. The Milky Way
was like a fold of silver gauze. The pines stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[336]</span>
up very black and silent in my grove. I began
to wonder why I ever slept indoors, when out in
the woods I felt as though I were in God’s house,
a partaker of his hospitality.</p>

<p>I relished my bed of pine needles extremely.
I began to ponder many things, the silence and
the stars served to give my thoughts a strange
turn, and I recalled what a well-loved writer has
said: “To live out of doors with the woman a
man loves is of all lives the most complete and
free.”</p>

<p>Yes, I said to myself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Wandering with the wandering wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Vagabond and unconfined.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Slowly I said over to myself the last verse of
the song—the verse I had not given to Wanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Marna of the far quest</div>
<div class="verse">After the divine!</div>
<div class="verse">Striving ever for some goal</div>
<div class="verse">Past the blunder-god’s control!</div>
<div class="verse">Dreaming of potential years</div>
<div class="verse">When no day shall dawn in fears!</div>
<div class="verse">That’s the Marna of my soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Wander-bride of mine!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Wander-bride of mine! Was it a woman like
Haidee who had suggested those lines to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
poet?— Haidee with her narrow, oval face, and
brow of ivory, and slow, bell-like voice. Or had
it been some elf-girl, some girl of flame with a
temperament wilder than most—a gipsy thing of
changing moods, and passionate phases of self-will,
alternating with abnegation and tenderness,—with
a face like a wind-blown flower, and
a nature very human, very lovable and rare!—a
girl like Wanza—say?</p>

<p>After a time I slept. When I awakened the
horizon showed a silvery light. The purple
darkness still mantled the woods and the stars
still shone, but day was coming on apace. As I
lay there, half dozing, and gradually becoming
tranquil and restored, I heard faint footfalls and
a modulated whistling on the road beyond.
There was a mellowness about the whistle that
was infinitely piquant, some quality that stirred
me as a bird’s song stirs. Doubtless some ranch
hand thus early astir, I said to myself.</p>

<p>I had not long to speculate, for the whistler
approached, left the road, and entered the grove
wherein I lay. I could hear a light crackling as
the invader of my solitude brushed through the
growth of young scrub pines. The whistle
changed to a low song, and the song was sung in
a woman’s voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>It was Wanza who was coming through the
pines toward me!</p>

<p>When she was comparatively near I spoke
from my couch beneath the tree.</p>

<p>“Hist! Hist! Wanza!”</p>

<p>The song ceased. I knew she was standing
stock still.</p>

<p>“Who—who—where are you?” her voice
sounded frightened.</p>

<p>“I’m David Dale. And I’m not ten feet from
you—follow my voice. Don’t trip on the tree
roots.”</p>

<p>She came towards me slowly. I stood up and
went to meet her. As I advanced a strange glee
took possession of me. I was elated at this unexpected
encounter, this beautiful rendezvous between
darkness and dawn in the pine forest.
And at the thought of a companion to watch
with me the coming in of day.</p>

<p>I took her hand silently. We went forward
to the pine tree and sat down together beneath
it. Wanza did not speak. I was enchanted because
she did not. I could just dimly see her
face. Her head was thrown back, and I knew
her eyes were lifted.</p>

<p>The light began to spread over the east. Soon
the mountain tops were touched with orange fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>
A cool breeze sprang up, and the young hemlocks
on the hillsides swayed and tossed their fringes.
But the pines in our grove stood immovable and
black, and the wood vistas were unlit. I heard
the river, and the babble of a rillet in a draw
hard by. The dulcet sounds were the only
sounds we heard. The whole world seemed waiting.
We sat thus for perhaps ten minutes, while
the light spread over the east and the purple
darkness of our grove gradually gave way to a
cool gray aspect. And then the sun came up, a
spurt of liquid amber in the urn of the sky, and
its light trickled far out over the hills, and the
stars grew pale and disappeared. The day had
come.</p>

<p>I was exhilarated. I was filled with full
measure of good will and gratification. And I
glanced at my companion, to read in her face her
appreciation of the miracle. She was smiling
ineffably, and as I turned fully towards her, she
closed her eyes. I became conscious then that I
was holding out my hand to her. I looked down
at it curiously, and I looked at her face, bent forward
and peered at it again. Who was this companion
who had shared my solitude, and by her
understanding made it perfect?—who had given
me quiet fellowship, sat near me in the starlight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
watched the day come in with me, and now rested
within reach of my hand? Who should it be, I
answered myself wonderingly, but my old friend
and companion, Wanza?</p>

<p>She opened her lids and I saw the wonder of
the sunrise in her eyes, and something mysterious
and deep blended with the languor of sleep.
And when she smiled at me and whispered my
name, I quivered suddenly and the blood surged
unbidden into my face. “Wanza,” I said,
“Wanza!”</p>

<p>“Yes?” she breathed.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it been wonderful, Wanza? Hasn’t
it been miraculous? ‘Every hour of the light
and dark’ is a miracle, but the sunrise is the
greatest one of all. It is arresting. I can never
drop off to sleep again if I waken and see the
sky rosy.” I spoke with a fluttered haste, my
words tumbling over each other in a way not at
all characteristic, and when Wanza whispered:
“Why, neither can I,” I laughed outright joyously.</p>

<p>“I found a wonderful wake-robin in the
woods yesterday,” I began after a pause; “the
petals were pink and strongly veined, and it was
monstrous—monstrous! petals two inches—well,
almost two inches. It must be a large-flowered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
wake-robin. The trilliums have been profuse
this spring. This fellow was belated—its companions
are all gone.”</p>

<p>“The robins woke up two months ago,”
Wanza said, shyly eager. “And they have
finished their courting.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are very wide-awake, and business-like.
But they have not finished their courting,—I
am sure I witnessed a love scene yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Not really, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“It looked uncommonly like one.”</p>

<p>In the growing light I saw that her face had
kindled. It was lifted to mine, and she was
drinking in every word. The emotion the sight
of that kindled face aroused in me started a train
of thought, and checked the words on my lips.
Oh, in very truth there was something puzzlingly
complex about my feeling for Wanza! I recoiled
as from some revelation that I did not care
to face as she continued to smile at me. But her
eyes drew me, and I leaned forward and peered
into them; and as once before I read their
message, but I continued to gaze this time until
the lashes swept down and the light was hid.</p>

<p>I walked back to the village with Wanza, and
there was the tinkle of bells on cattle awake in
the meadows, and the stir of sheep milling on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
rocky hillsides, and the crowing of cocks and the
chirp of birds to proclaim that morning had
come. We were almost at the village when she
put a question to me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dale, do you know what day to-morrow
is?”</p>

<p>I had been expecting the question and dreading
it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I answered, “I know well that it is the
day we have been accustomed to celebrate as
Joey’s birthday.”</p>

<p>I spoke impatiently. But when I saw the
tears in her eyes, I stopped there in the road and
took her by the shoulders and turned her around
to me ruthlessly, crying:</p>

<p>“Listen to me! You must be hurt, if you will,
at my surliness, Wanza Lyttle! I cannot keep
my tongue smooth when my nerves are ragged.
We go on and on, and bear much—stoically—for
weeks, months, years, indeed, and then—suddenly,
we can bear no more! We reach the
pinnacle of pain. We cry out—with the poignancy
of it. But after that, I have a fancy, we
can never suffer so much again. I am at the
pinnacle. There is no last straw for me. It has
been placed. After to-morrow the worst will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
over. God! let me get through the day and play
the man.”</p>

<p>She said not a word. We parted silently.
But after I had gone a little way she came running
after me.</p>

<p>“I only wanted to say, David Dale,” she
breathed, “I only wanted to say—”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wanza?”</p>

<p>“I only wanted to say, ‘God bless you.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI<br />


<small>THE OLD SWIMMING HOLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AND so I came to the day that was sacred
to Joey!</p>

<p>I began it by ploughing in the field
back of the cabin. I went not near the shop. I
did not venture into the cabin for lunch at noon.
I had made up my mind to work doggedly till
sundown and then go to the village inn for
supper, and later join Father O’Shan at Captain
Grif’s. Someway it comforted me to think of
the evening; of the snug little nook beneath the
eaves; and of the welcome that awaited me there.
I saw Wanza’s face, in fancy—solicitous,
pleased; I saw her figure there in the centre of
the room, clasped by the yellow light of the
swinging lamp, her hair gilded by its rays, on
her cheek an eager flush. Kind heart! Dear,
helpful girl! Cheerful, buoyant, valiant little
wander-friend!</p>

<p>The sun for a June sun was unduly fervid, so
that by four o’clock I was weary and dripping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span>
with perspiration, and longing for a dip in the
river. I rested, and leaning on my plough,
looked away through the cedars and cottonwoods
to the green of the river flashing in the sunlight.
I heard the rattle of the stage on the road, and
when I was certain it had passed I went to the
cabin and put on my bathing suit. I went in at
the back door of the cabin, and out at the front,
passed through the yew grove, crossed the bridge
to the shop, and so gained the river bank and my
favorite swimming hole beneath the cedar trees.</p>

<p>The spreading trees threw a deep shade over
the pool. It was almost twilight beneath their
network of branches. And I was on the bank
prepared for a dive before I saw a small figure
below me seated on a boulder at the edge of the
water, half hidden from view by the steep slope
of the bank. I saw the flash of bare feet in the
water. Poised ready to spring I gave a shout,
“Look out,” and shot out over the small figure
and into the pool.</p>

<p>When I came up, blowing like a porpoise, the
figure was standing waist deep in water and
waving thin excited arms abroad. I saw the
face. It was gaunt, fever-bright, and not like
my lad’s as I had seen it last, but it was Joey
who stood there.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span>I lifted him up and he clasped my neck almost
to strangulation, wrapping his long legs around
me, and I raced with him to the house. Once inside
I stripped him, seized a towel and rubbed
his cold little body until it glowed, and he laughed
and cried and laughed again, and clutched my
neck and finally stammered:</p>

<p>“I got—got here! I come for my birthday—all
the way from the East alone.”</p>

<p>“Alone!”</p>

<p>“Yep! And I’m going to stay. Going to
stay forever—Bell Brandon said so. They’s a
letter in my satchel for you.”</p>

<p>I hugged him to my breast.</p>

<p>“But what were you doing in the swimming
hole, Joey?”</p>

<p>He looked at me, smiled his shrewd young
smile, and said:</p>

<p>“Washing off the dust and—and tidying myself.
Let’s see the cake, now, Mr. David.”</p>

<p>“The cake?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “Hasn’t Wanza baked it yet?”</p>

<p>“Why, Joey lad, we haven’t any ready to-day!
Can’t you understand?”</p>

<p>His face grew blank, his eyes filled, and he
shivered suddenly; he seemed to shrivel in my
arms, and he turned his head away from me.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[347]</span>“What is it, Joey?”</p>

<p>“I—I—don’t anybody want me?”</p>

<p>“Want you?” I was aghast. “There, and
there, and there,” I cried, giving him a rapid succession
of hugs. “Doesn’t this look as though I
wanted you?”</p>

<p>“Is Wanza sick?” There was something
hopeful in his tone.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “Wanza is very well, lad.”</p>

<p>Again that blank look, that delicate shiver.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a fire going in no time, lad, and
a cake in the oven, and the blue dishes on the
table. And say the word and I’ll slap the saddle
on Buttons and ride post-haste to Wanza and
tell her I have a wonderful, wonderful surprise
for her—that Joey has come back, after we had
given up hoping. I’ll bring her here—shall I,
Joey?—to help bake the cake. Oh, dear, dear
lad!—” I cried, and broke down.</p>

<p>Such a shout as he gave. He had me by the
neck and was clinging to me like a wild young
savage. “You didn’t get my letter—you didn’t,
you didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Did you write, Joey?”</p>

<p>“Yep, sure I wrote. Course I wrote. Soon
as Bell Brandon told me I belonged to you really
and truly I wrote and I let Bell Brandon put a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[348]</span>
letter in the envelope with mine. I put your
name on the outside. I printed Mr. David, as
careful, and Bell Brandon watched me. She
made me write Dale on it, too. But when she
wasn’t looking I rubbed out the Dale part, and
I mailed it myself on the corner. I told you to
spect me on my birthday, and Bell Brandon told
you to meet me at Spokane ’cause I was coming
all alone from Chicago.”</p>

<p>Poor lad! Poor disappointed lad! He gave
a strange, tired sigh, but meeting my somber eyes,
brightened. “I like traveling alone. Pooh!
I’d liever travel alone than—than anything.
But when you didn’t meet me at Roselake even,
I thought—I thought p’r’aps you didn’t want
me! And when I got out of the stage at the
meadow and cut across, and peeked at the cabin
and you wasn’t around, I was ’most sure you
didn’t want me. And then I saw how dirty I
was, and I thought I’d tidy up first before you
saw me, anyhow.”</p>

<p>I went back to the river bank, sought for and
found Joey’s traveling bag and carried it to the
house. Joey brought out of its depths a letter
and handed it to me. But I did not read it at
once. I put my lad in a big chair in the kitchen,
and I built a fire in the stove and I set out flour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span>
and sugar and molasses, all the while praying
that Wanza would appear. I laid the table in
the front room with the best blue china, and I
got out the pressed glass comport; and I
gathered handfuls of syringa and honeysuckle,
and brought them in the big yellow pitcher to
Joey, saying:</p>

<p>“You may arrange these, Joey, for the table.”</p>

<p>But to my surprise he took the flowers listlessly,
and when I glanced around after a few
moments I saw that he had set the pitcher down
on the floor and was leaning back in the chair with
closed eyes. I went and stood at his side, but he
did not open his eyes.</p>

<p>“Tired, Joey?”</p>

<p>He yawned. “Terrible tired, Mr. David.”</p>

<p>I looked at him irresolutely, then gathered him
up in my arms.</p>

<p>“Come along, old fellow, lie down on your bed
in the cedar room, and sleep till supper’s ready,”
I suggested.</p>

<p>His hand stroked my cheek with the old caress.
He yawned again. I lifted him and carried him
to the cedar room and placed him on the bed. I
took off his shoes and drew the shawl-flower quilt
over him. He spoke then:</p>

<p>“Tell Wanza when she comes, to wake me first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[350]</span>
thing. I love Bell Brandon—but I love Wanza
best. I guess—I’ll—sleep pretty good—with
this dear old quilt over me—” his voice grew indistinct,
he stretched, blinked once or twice,
closed his eyes, and snuggled luxuriously into his
pillows. I tiptoed from the room.</p>

<p>In the front room I sat down by the window,
took Haidee’s letter from my pocket and read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I hope nothing will prevent you from meeting Joey
in Spokane,” I read. “I have heard nothing from you
on that point. But I am almost sure you received my
letter telling you of my illness and inability to travel,
and asking you to meet Joey on the fifth. I cannot
but believe Bill Jobson’s story—strange as it seems.
My own little boy is gone forever.</p>

<p>“When you receive this Joey will be with you—there
in the old place that he loves so dearly. And you—how
you will rejoice to have your lad again. Bless you
both! David Dale, I shall not visit Hidden Lake this
summer,—I have learned much in these past months.
Do you not know your own heart yet? I have read
carefully, searchingly all the letters you have written
me this past winter, and I find Wanza, Wanza, between
the lines. She is the true mate for you—can you not
see this? Do you not feel it? Do you not know you
love her—as she loves you? I knew I should reach a
happy solution of our problem—given the much needed
perspective; and the solution is this—you love Wanza
Lyttle, and I care for you only as a dear, kind friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span>“No, I shall not visit Hidden Lake this year. Perhaps
next summer—but ‘To-morrow is a day too far
to trust whate’er the day be.’ I shall never forget
Joey or you, or your wonderful kindness and friendship.
Good-bye, Mr. Fixing Man,—or not good-bye!
au revoir. Oh, all the good wishes in the world I send
to you and Joey—and Wanza.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Judith Batterly.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>When I finished this letter I sat quietly,
watching curiously a white butterfly—a Pine
White—skimming back and forth above a flowering
currant bush that grew close to the window.
I found myself strangely impassive. I said to
myself that Haidee was mistaken about my feeling
for Wanza; but I experienced no sense of
bereavement because she had found that her own
feeling for me was that of a friend, merely. I
was not even surprised. “I have Joey,” I kept
repeating over and over to myself, hugging this
comfort to my breast. There was a fear back
of my exultation in the lad’s possession. A fear
that was strong enough to force the full significance
of Haidee’s communication into the background
of my mind. Was my lad ill? Was he
really ill? I asked myself. He was thin, and his
cheeks were feverishly bright, and his voice
sounded tired,—but, was he a sick child?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span>I went back to the kitchen, looked at the ingredients
set forth on the table and then out of
the window anxiously. If only Wanza would
come and a wonderful spice cake could be in the
oven when Joey awakened. If only— But
here I broke off in my musings, for I heard a
strange sound from the cedar room.</p>

<p>I went as fast as my feet could carry me to
the room where I had left my boy. I found him
lying, face downward on the floor, where he had
evidently fallen when he attempted to walk from
his bed to the door. I lifted him, turned his face
to me, and examined it. It was flushed so deep
a red as to be almost purple. His eyes were
open, but he did not seem to see me, his lips were
parted, the breath was hot on my face. I placed
him on the bed, and he murmured unintelligibly.</p>

<p>I knew then that my lad was ill, indeed, and
when I heard a step behind me and saw Wanza
on the threshold, I ran and caught her hand.
“Thank God, you have come,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“They told me in Roselake Joey was back,”
she cried, and brushed past me to the bed.</p>

<p>I turned and went from the room. A few
moments later she came to me.</p>

<p>“What has she done to him? What has she
done to him?” she burst forth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span>“She has done nothing, Wanza.”</p>

<p>“Why did you say, ‘Thank God’?” she cried,
fiercely. “Do you think <i>I</i> can save him? Mr.
Dale, he is sick—he is very sick—he has pined
and pined—for a sight of you, and Jingles and
Buttons. What do you think he said just now?—raving
as he is. ‘Will I go back soon, Bell
Brandon? No, thank you, I can’t eat—I guess
I want Mr. David, and Jingles and Buttons, and
my own little cedar room.’ If he dies—David
Dale—if he dies!—”</p>

<p>“Please—please, Wanza—”</p>

<p>She looked into my face, her eyes were black
with emotion.</p>

<p>“Saddle Buttons and go at once for a doctor!
I’ll put Joey in a cold pack while you’re gone;
he’s burning with fever.”</p>

<p>“Practical, capable, ever ready to serve; lavish
of her affection, staunch in her friendship, ‘steel
true,—blade straight,’—that is Wanza,” I said
to myself as I rode away.</p>

<p>The outcome of the doctor’s visit was that I
sent for Mrs. Olds. Wanza and I got through
the night somehow, and the next day Mrs. Olds
came. I think this strange being entertained
some slight tenderness for Joey, for when she
saw him lying among his pillows with heavy-lidded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span>
eyes and fever-seared cheeks, she stooped
and touched his brow very gently with her lips.
Joey recognized her when she entered the room
late at night in her heelless slippers and flannel
dressing-gown, and set her small clock on the
shelf above the bed. “Mrs. Olds,” he ordered
distinctly, “take that clock out to the kitchen.”</p>

<p>Taken by surprise, Mrs. Olds protested:
“There, there, Joey, don’t bother with me—that’s
a good boy. Just close your eyes and go to sleep
again.”</p>

<p>“I don’t watch the clock! Mr. David says the
Now is the thing. Take it out! When the birds
sing I’ll get up.”</p>

<p>But the birds sang and Joey did not awaken.
He slept heavily all that day. And when he
aroused toward midnight he did not know me.
The following day he was worse, and that night
I despaired. In his delirium he said things that
well nigh crazed me. His mutterings were all
of me, with an occasional reference to the collie
and Buttons. “I don’t like to leave Mr. David
alone, so long,” he kept repeating. “I ’most
know he wants me back again—I been his boy so
long.”</p>

<p>Presently when he sobbed out shrilly: “I just
got to go back to Mr. David!” I arose precipitately,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[355]</span>
quitted the room and went out to the
bench in the Dingle.</p>

<p>But some one already was sitting there. I
could see her in the light from the room. A girl
in a rose-colored dressing-gown with long braids
down her back, sat there, looking up at the star-filled
sky through the tree branches. I advanced
and she made room for me at her side. I sat
down, too stunned, too grief stricken for words.
We sat there in silence. Presently her uneven
breathing, her sobbing under-breaths, disturbed
me.</p>

<p>“Please—please, Wanza—don’t,” I begged.</p>

<p>“I’ve been praying,” she stammered.</p>

<p>“That is well, dear girl.”</p>

<p>“Praying that Joey will live.”</p>

<p>“It seems a small thing for God to grant—in
his omnipotence. It is everything in the world
to me,” I murmured brokenly. “Why, girl, if
my boy lives I shall be the happiest man on God’s
footstool! I shall be immeasurably content. I
shall ask nothing beside—nothing!”</p>

<p>She stirred. “Nothing, Mr. Dale—nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Dale, you think so now—but you’ll
be wanting <i>her</i> to come back—you can’t help
wanting that!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>“I am very sure I shall never ask for that,
Wanza. Joey brought me a letter. She is not
coming back this year.”</p>

<p>“Not coming back?”</p>

<p>“She may never come again to Hidden Lake,
Wanza. We may never see her again.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand, David Dale!—oh, I
thought some day you would marry—you and
she.”</p>

<p>Her voice was uneven and very low.</p>

<p>“Child,” I said gravely, “it is not to be. She
cares for me only as a friend. And I—”</p>

<p>“You love her—you know you do!”</p>

<p>She spoke passionately.</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I said thoughtfully, “it has been a
long winter, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Pretty long,” she answered, surprised.</p>

<p>“You have learned much this winter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“And I have learned, too—without knowing
it. I have learned very gradually that I do not
love Judith Batterly—so gradually, indeed, that
I did not realize until to-day the extent of my
knowledge. She told me in her letter it was so—then
I knew.”</p>

<p>She sat very still, her head thrown back, her
eyes on the sky. The stirring leaves made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[357]</span>
shadows on her gown, the moonlight flicked
through the vines above her, and her hair glittered
like gilt. Her eyes were big and shining, and
something on her cheek was shining, too.</p>

<p>“Praying—still, Wanza?” I whispered, after
a time.</p>

<p>She put out her hand.</p>

<p>“Please, Wanza, say a prayer for me.”</p>

<p>“I am praying that what you told me is true.”</p>

<p>“It is true. Pray that I be forgiven for being
a stupid, clumsy fellow, unable to appreciate your
true worth—” I stopped. I was being carried
on and I knew not where I desired to pause. I
checked myself, and bit my lip.</p>

<p>“I could not offer such a prayer,” I heard her
say. “I am not worth anything to anybody, Mr.
Dale, except to Father. I am going to try,
though, to make myself all over—knowing you
want me to improve, and to show you I take your
kindness to heart. I think I am improving a
little, don’t you? I don’t talk so loud, and I
dress quieter—more quietly—and I speak better.
Can’t you see an improvement, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“Someway, Wanza,” I replied, speaking musingly,
“I like you as you are—as you have
always been. It is only for your own sake that
I care to have you improve.” And as I said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[358]</span>
words I realized that this thought had been in
the back of my mind for some time, and that
Wanza’s piquant utterances and lapses in English
had never jarred on me—that it was strictly
true that it was only for Wanza’s own sake I
would have her changed.</p>

<p>“You like me as I am?”</p>

<p>The voice was incredulous.</p>

<p>“As well as I shall when you have finished
your education, child.”</p>

<p>“As well?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You won’t like me better then?”</p>

<p>“No, no better, Wanza.”</p>

<p>She rose and stood before me. The light from
the open door of the cedar room was on her face,
and I saw hopelessness in her eyes, and a tremulousness
about her lovely child-mouth.</p>

<p>“You will never like me very, very much, then,
I guess,” she said in a low tone.</p>

<p>She did not give me a chance to respond to
this, but turned and went away through the
cedars, and I sat still, saying over to myself:
“Very, very much.”</p>

<p>And as I said the words I thrilled; my blood
seemed to surge into my eyes and blind me.
Something had me by the throat. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
strange moment. In that moment I had a
glimpse of the truth—a white light illumined my
seeking, groping senses. Then it was gone. I
was in darkness again. But in that brief lightning
space I had stood on the brink of a revelation.
In the weeks and months past, through
the blinding—the fervid—gleam of my feeling
for Haidee I had seen Wanza but obscurely—Wanza—tried
day after day by homeliest duties,
and not found wanting; I had seen that she had
her own bookless lore as she had her own indisputable
charm; I had known that at times she
swayed me; but I had never come so near to
knowing my heart as in that evanescent, stabbing,
revealing, moment.</p>

<p>As I sat there I felt a sudden sense of rest,
almost of emancipation. I was weary of cob-webbed
dreams, sick of straining after the unattainable.
My thoughts reverted to life as it had
been in the old days before the coming of the
wonder woman, to the days when Joey and
Wanza and I had managed to go through the
tedium of our hours placidly enough. I longed
to take up the old, sane routine. I was impatient
with suffering that chafed and gnawed the heart-strings.</p>

<p>I said to myself that all that was left of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
former feeling for Haidee was admiration, reverence
for her goodness, and a wonder—she was a
dream woman—she would remain a dream
woman always—an elusive, charming personality,
something too fine for the common round
of daylight duties. I thought of the poet’s lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I love thee to the level of every day’s most quiet
need, by sun and candle light.”</p>
</div>

<p>Had I thought of Haidee so?</p>

<p>When I turned back to the cedar room, Mrs.
Olds met me at the door with a whispered, “Joey
is lucid—he is asking for you.” I crossed swiftly
to the bed, knelt down and took my lad’s hand.
He smiled at me in his old way, but his eyes went
past me to Mrs. Olds. His voice was distinct as
he ordered, “Go, get Wanza, Mrs. Olds, please.”</p>

<p>I heard Wanza’s step at that moment. She
came softly forward and crouched beside me.
“I am here, Joey,” she said in her rich young
voice.</p>

<p>“That’s all right then! Wanza; if I don’t get
well you got to marry Mr. David.”</p>

<p>The troubled face bending down over the gray
one on the pillow, flamed. “Joey—dear!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Wanza,” pleadingly, “cause who’ll take
care of him?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[361]</span>I cleared my throat. “Come, lad, you will be
well in a few days—up and around in the woods,
feeding the squirrels.”</p>

<p>“Yes—but if I ain’t!” Tender, wistful, questioning,
his loyal brown eyes sought Wanza’s.
“You got to, Wanza. Say yes.”</p>

<p>The girl’s voice whimpered and broke. “I
can’t!”</p>

<p>“Why, yes you can! They’s no one can cook
like you, Wanza. Mr. David can’t live here
alone when he’s old—he can’t live here alone no
more—say you’ll come and take care of him.
Why, you like the birds and the squirrels—you
know you do, Wanza—and you like Mr. David,
too. Will you, Wanza?” The soft wheedling
accents wrung my heart.</p>

<p>At the girl’s head-shake he whispered to me,
“You ask her, Mr. David.”</p>

<p>My hand groped for hers, closed over it,
gripped it hard.</p>

<p>“If I ask her now—if she says yes, lad—it will
be for your sake—all for your sake, Joey.”</p>

<p>The big eyes were understanding. “Go on,
ask her.”</p>

<p>“Will you, Wanza?”</p>

<p>She was weeping.</p>

<p>“Because Joey asks it—because it will ease his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
mind,” I heard her choked voice stammer, “only
because of that, Mr. Dale—only for Joey’s sake
as you say—I promise if—if you need me—” she
came to a dead stop.</p>

<p>“To marry me, Wanza.”</p>

<p>“For Joey’s sake, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“There, Joey!” I shook up his pillow and
laid him gently back. “It is all settled, lad.
Go to sleep now.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me, once, Mr. David.”</p>

<p>I kissed him.</p>

<p>“Kiss Wanza, now.”</p>

<p>Weariness was heavy in his eyes, his voice was
quavering and weak; and forgetting all else but
his gratification, forgetting Mrs. Olds, propriety,
the consequences of so rash an act, I took Wanza
in my arms and kissed her lips, then stumbled
blindly from the room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>MY WONDER WOMAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN I saw Master Joey smiling at
me wanly from his pillow the next
morning, his fever gone, his eyes
without the abnormal brightness of the previous
two days, and heard his modest request for cornmeal
flapjacks to be stirred up forthwith in the
old yellow pitcher, my heart leaped into my
throat for joy. I was so riotously happy that I
went outside to the Dingle, and almost burst my
throat with whistling a welcome to a lazuli-bunting,
newly arrived from his winter sojourn in the
south land. He was so azure-blue on his head
and back, so tawny breasted, so clear a white on
his underparts that he seemed like some wondrous
jewel dropped from Paradise into the
syringa thicket.</p>

<p>I had answered his “here, here—” until I was
sure he understood the cordiality of my welcome,
when I heard a fluttering among the serviceberry
bushes and turned to see a sage thrasher fly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
out and soar aloft to a hemlock tree. I whistled.
He answered with a beautiful song, and went on
to imitate other birds’ songs, ending by emitting
a sound that was strangely like the wail of a
naughty youngster. I laughed outright, and it
seemed to me he was attempting to imitate my
laughter as I walked away. The birds were
coming back in earnest. How glorious the early
summer was! Was there ever such a rose-gold
morning? I was overflowing with happiness.
But when on my way to the spring I hailed
Wanza, who was dipping water out of the big
barrel by the kitchen door, and received a delicately
frigid “good morning,” something rather
strange came over me, my glowing heart congealed,
and I went out to the yew grove, and sat
down soberly on the railing of the small bridge
that spanned the narrow mountain stream.</p>

<p>I had no quarrel with Wanza for her averted
face. But I had a feeling that the blunder-god
had unwarrantably interfered again, and a wish
to lift my affairs up off the knees of the gods once
and for all and swing them myself. I felt big
enough to swing them, this morning. Only—I
did not exactly understand the state of my own
mind, and this was some slight detriment to clean
swinging.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[365]</span>For one thing—after I had touched Wanza’s
unwilling lips last night at Joey’s bidding, I had
sat on the edge of my bunk in the darkness unable
to forget the feeling of those warm lips
against my own—feeling myself revitalized—made
new. What had happened to me when I
held the girl in my arms for that brief space?
What was the answer?</p>

<p>I sat in deep thought, starting when a water
ouzel swooped suddenly down past my face, and
plunged into the water at my very feet. I
watched it emerge, perch on a boulder further
down stream, and spread its slaty wings to dry.
The day was languorous, and very sweet. One
of those perfect days that come early in June
when the woods are flower-filled, and the trees
full-leaved. The air was tangy with smells, the
honeysuckle and balm o’ Gilead dripped perfume,
the clover was bursting with sweetness, and
the wild roses were faintly odorous; all the “buds
and bells” of June were dewy and clean-scented.
The nutty flavor of yarrow was in the air—Achillea
millefolium—the plant which Achilles
is said to have used in an ointment to heal his
myrmidons wounded in the siege of Troy. I
marked this last flavor well, separating it from
the others. “Poor yarrow,” I said to myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[366]</span>
“content with spurious corners and waste portions
of the earth, what a splendid lesson of perseverance
you teach.” I thought of myself and
of my struggle of the last eight years, and compared
myself with the weed. I had not been content
with the neglected corners of the earth; but
I had honestly tried to make the best of the corners;
I had attempted to improve them, and in
so doing improve myself.</p>

<p>From that I came to Joey and the two women
who had helped to make the waste places bloom;
and like Byron I had a sigh for Joey and Wanza
who loved me; and I had a tender smile for my
dream woman—Haidee. She had come when,
steeped in idealism, I was all prepared for the
advent of the radiant creature who was to work
a metamorphosis in my life. She had come, and
I had hailed her Wonder Woman. It had been
a psychological moment, and she had appeared.
And I had loved her—let me not cheat myself
into any contrary belief—surely I had loved her—surely;
let me admit that. But no—I need
not admit even that, since it was not the truth—since
she knew it was not the truth. I had loved
an ideal; not Judith Batterly, indeed, but a
vague dream woman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[367]</span>“There is no wonder woman,” I said to myself,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Restless with my cogitations, I rose, left the
bridge, and went through the yews to the workshop.</p>

<p>When in sight of the bed of clove pinks I
pulled myself up smartly; Wanza knelt there.
I was not too far away to see the glitter of tears
on her cheeks; but in spite of the tears, she was
smiling; her face was downbent, rose-flushed, to
the new buds, her hands were clasped on her
breast, she seemed lost in ecstatic revery, and on
her head rested delicately a nuthatch.</p>

<p>“What a wonderful way Wanza has with the
birds,” I said to myself. I turned this over in
my mind. “I’ve long marked it,” I added.
Presently still watching her, I decided, “She is a
rather wonderful child.”</p>

<p>I continued to watch her.</p>

<p>She began to croon a soft little song; she unclasped
her hands and held them out before her.
A second nuthatch left the branch of a pine tree
nearby and descended to settle on her left hand.
She gave an indistinct gurgle of joy, and put her
right hand over it.</p>

<p>“Why, she’s a wonder,” I said to myself, “a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[368]</span>
wonder—girl!” I hesitated, and then exultantly
I murmured: “A wonder woman!” and turned
and beat a hasty retreat to the cabin.</p>

<p>Arrived there I sat down rather breathlessly
on the steps. I saw light at last!</p>

<p>It was under the stars that night that I told
Wanza of my discovery. Joey was sleeping
peacefully indoors, watched over by Mrs. Olds,
the doctor had just left, after assuring me that
my lad would soon be convalescent, and Wanza
and I walked on the river bank.</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I said, “is that a russet-backed
thrush singing?”</p>

<p>“I think so, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“His notes are wonderfully liquid and round,
aren’t they?” I gave a sigh of pure happiness.
“I feel like a ‘strong bird on pinions free,’ myself
to-night. I feel emancipated—as though life
were beginning all over for me. I am in love
with life, Wanza. I want to awake to-morrow
and begin life all over.”</p>

<p>“Do you, Mr. Dale?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t the world beautiful washed in this moonlight!
The sky seems so near—like a purple
silk curtain strung with jewels. But it is quite
dark here beneath the pines, isn’t it, Wanza? I
have to guess at the flowers under our feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
There is white hawthorn nearby, I swear, and the
yellow violets are in the grass, and the wild forget-me-not,
and I smell the wild roses—”</p>

<p>“How you go on, Mr. Dale!”</p>

<p>“Wanza,” I said, “look up at the stars through
the pine branches.”</p>

<p>“I like to watch them in the river.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but look up, Wanza.”</p>

<p>She looked as I bade her.</p>

<p>“The moonlight in your eyes is wonderful,
child.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“Keep looking at the stars, Wanza—your face
is like an angel’s seen thus. Your hair is like
silver starshine, your lips are flowers—you are
very wonderful—my breath fails me, Wanza.
You are very wonderful—a wonder woman—and
I love you. Will you marry me?”</p>

<p>“Joey isn’t going to die, Mr. Dale.”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>She spoke with a sobbing breath: “Then why
do you say this?”</p>

<p>“Because I love you with my whole soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“Turn your eyes to me, dear. Don’t look at
the stars any more. Do you love me?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span>“Then at last I shall be blessed—I shall have
a wander-bride—a wonder woman—some one
who understands me, and whom I understand, to
share with me the coming in of day, the mystery
of the night and stars, the saneness of the moon—I
shall have—Wanza! Do you remember,
child:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Down the world with Marna!</div>
<div class="verse">That’s the life for me!</div>
<div class="verse">Wandering with the wandering wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Vagabond and unconfined!’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Do you remember the song I sang to you in
the woods one night? There is another verse—listen!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">“‘Marna of the far quest</div>

<div class="verse">When no day shall dawn in fears!</div>
<div class="verse">That’s the Marna of my soul,</div>
<div class="verse">Wander-bride of mine!’”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The beautiful face was on my breast, the cornflower
blue eyes were raised to mine, the maize-colored
hair was like a curtain about us, shutting
out the moonlight, the night, the world. I drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
her closer, closer still, silently, breathlessly, until
I heard her give a shaken cry:</p>

<p>“It’s in your eyes—I can read it! You do
love me, you do, you do! David Dale! David
Dale!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After an interval, I said:</p>

<p>“I am writing another book, Wanza. I am
sure it will sell. We will go away from here,
child—we can live where we choose—we will go
south to my old home. There is some property
there that is mine. You will love the old home,
and the river with its red clay banks—my childhood’s
home. We will travel, too. Life seems
very full, Wanza.”</p>

<p>“But we’ll always come back to Cedar Dale,
won’t we, David Dale? We’ll come back to Dad—dear
Dad—he’ll always be waiting. And the
birds and the flowers—and the squirrels and
woodsy things will be waiting. And Joey will
want to come.”</p>
